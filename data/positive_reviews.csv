2023-05-23,Economy Class,  Easy check in on the way to Heathrow. The flight was on time with no issues. Our return flight to Valencia was booked for the afternoon and our long haul flight arrived early at Heathrow. This was with another airline and was not a connecting flight. I asked at the British Airways check in if we could be put onto the morning flight back to Valencia to avoid seven hours waiting at Heathrow. We had our flights changed with no cost and were checked in within five minutes. That is indeed customer service. Thank you.,yes,2023,0.013518148,0.10943247,0.8770494,0
2023-05-23,Economy Class,"  Online check in worked fine. Quick security check. Once onboard quick flight up to Glasgow, water and snack provided. All in all very pleased. Cheap, quick and efficient.",yes,2023,0.002139091,0.034534708,0.9633262,0
2023-04-22,Premium Economy,"  Second time BA Premium Economy in a newer aircraft and yet another excellent experience. Despite a three hour delay and missing my connection in Hong Kong, this was a very pleasant flight. Seats are spacious and comfortable in Premium Economy in this layout, attitude of the cabin crew was excellent and food was good. They communicate well and rebooked my connection during the flight which brought peace of mind. A very pleasant experience in BA Premium Economy after a major disappointment in Club World earlier this year.",yes,2023,0.003952457,0.020537447,0.97551006,-1
2023-04-11,Business Class,"  I enjoyed my flight. The boarding was swift and service was very friendly and professional. The food selection was good and I enjoyed the quality. The was only one downside - when we landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at T5, so in total from landing to getting the doors open it took 30 minutes. I believe the Heathrow T5 were having strike action that week.",yes,2023,0.07650572,0.18971218,0.7337821,-1
2023-04-09,Economy Class,"  I swore I would never fly BA again after they messed me about so much when trying to get to Budapest. But the times for their flights suited me so I decided to give them another go. The flight left on time (just about), the cabin was clean and the staff friendly. There was even complimentary tea/coffee and a breakfast bar to be had for economy. The flight was pleasant enough and I can't think of any negatives to write about. The flight and service was certainly head and shoulders above my trip with easyjet.",yes,2023,0.08198616,0.20112474,0.71688914,-1
2023-03-31,Economy Class," Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic and badly organised. Once on board the crew announcements were professional, relaxed and informative in typical BA style. The seat was quite comfortable. It was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good. I was lucky that the middle seat was empty so I didn’t suffer from the new narrow seat which I think would have made it a lot less comfortable. The IFE is excellent, responsive and good quality. There is an enormous selection of TV and movies and a good number of games. WIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I don’t think £17.99 for full flight is bad value. You can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging. Cabin crew were very good. Friendly and efficient. Catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight, the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough. Landing and processing at Heathrow was astonishingly quick - it felt like it was 3am, even though it was 6:30pm! No queues or waiting at all. Even the baggage was super quick at coming through. Overall a very solid experience in economy. Significantly better than it used to be.",yes,2023,0.015941756,0.07901699,0.9050412,-1
2023-03-30,Business Class," Mexico City Airport is a zoo, but taking the late departure on BA to LHR isn't too bad. Club passengers can use the AA Admirals Lounge, which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to BA's club passengers only at this time of day. Lovely staff, solid food & bar, really pleasant. We flew an older 787 with the old style club seats. Seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner. Come to think of it, I will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-out. There is no better way to fly when you are a couple. We were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle. Still terrible you have to pay for these seats, but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats. Flying BA when the crew is good is amazing. Service was impecable on this flight. Just the right mix of humor, service and attention. Food seemed to be good as well, but hardly touched it. I am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better. On time departure, smooth flight and early arrival at Heathrow. We went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track. Security at LHR has always been terrible, but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks. We had a lovely shower at the 'spa', what a fabulous facility. The South Lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster. Who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess! Food on offer was solid and so are the drinks. Our home stretch to Amsterdam was pretty straight forward. Lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar-cart service. I love the 'double'-servings of drinks. English tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and I really don't understand BA stuck to it through the years. No-one like the cucumber white bread things, but hey... On time landing in Amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a 20 minute late arrival, why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in Amsterdam? Flying club in BA is still wonderful. I Love it!",yes,2023,0.10023592,0.19495119,0.7048129,-1
2023-03-18,Premium Economy," First time flying with British Airways and first time flying to the Americas from India via London Heathrow. I chose Premium Economy at a reasonable price. I was quite comfortable, however, the first leg of the flight from Mumbai to Heathrow, the plane was a bit outdated and there was only a foot rest. The second leg, from Heathrow to Nassau, the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable. Cabin service was fine - I appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The meals weren't that great to be honest. After landing in Heathrow, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate. My connection was less than an hour long! The BA staff in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through security quickly and I made it with time to spare for my next flight. When I arrived in Nassau, I found that my luggage didn't make it due to the short connection time in London. The BA baggage representative in Nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim. My luggage arrived on the next BA flight a few days later, and British Airways Nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the island I was staying on. Very impressive and efficient!",yes,2023,0.03991924,0.19938701,0.7606937,-1
2023-03-09,Economy Class," A short BA euro trip and this is where BA excel. Clean aircraft, good crew, professional, on time (within LHR standards) and a good value product delivered. Pity the in flight food sales were not a bit more exciting and appealing as more than a few asked about the non existent hot food options. But good overall. Check in self service is great now once you know how to use it with plenty assistance on hand for those who can’t.",yes,2023,0.015901225,0.08317494,0.90092385,4
2023-03-02,Economy Class,"  Would happily fly them again. I had a personal emergency and was allowed to reschedule my flights free of charge. Onboard service on LHR-IST was no frills, but JFK-LHR was impeccable: good food, lots of movies/cds on the IFE, open bar service the entire flight. Friendly flight attendants always happy to provide an extra drink/snack.",yes,2023,0.0031574026,0.03263653,0.96420604,4
2023-02-27,Economy Class,"  Although it was a bit uncomfortable flight in an economy, the flight attendants made the flight the best possibly could.  Such a nice and professional crew. Very attentive and looking out for their customers.",yes,2023,0.016526833,0.07216623,0.911307,4
2023-02-27,Business Class," Boarding on time and departure on time for a flight to London Heathrow that is very ok, the A320 with rather narrow seats. In business light meal a Caesars salad, a mousse as sweet and choice of drinks - nothing wrong for such a short flight. FA's were very friendly and landing on time.",yes,2023,0.007369767,0.089825444,0.90280473,5
2023-02-16,Economy Class," This was my first time flying with BA & I was pleasantly surprised. Islamabad via Doha was very comfortable and the crew were great, friendly and helpful. The second flight was operated by Qatar Airways this was from Doha to Islamabad. My return journey was a direct BA flight, 46kg luggage allowance was really generous and stopped the hassle with connecting flights. Crew on this flight were really nice too. What let BA down was the food, it really was not nice, the IFE could do with some more content but that's not really a huge issue.",yes,2023,0.038631402,0.1371734,0.8241952,-1
2023-02-07,Business Class," BA 242 on the 6/2/23. Boarding was delayed due to late arrival from the incoming flight. Communication from the ground staff was excellent and keep us informed. In flight services were excellent, the crews were friendly with excellent service! Overall, very happy with BA.",yes,2023,0.0050968467,0.03893708,0.95596606,-1
2023-02-06,Economy Class,"  Not only my first flight in 17 years, but also my first time back to England for 17 years. I flew from PMI-LGW on 21/01/2023 and returned on 29/01/2023. Both Wizz Air and EasyJet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for baggage. British Airways were the most convenient and best value option available, they offered ideal flight times and the €18 charge per flight for baggage was very reasonable - Total cost for both flights was €126 +/- Regular update information via email, seamless online seat allocation and check in. Efficient staff at the check in desks at PMI and LGW ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible. Immaculate aircraft, comfortable leather seats with adequate legroom (I'm 6'4"" tall) Cabin crew were polite, friendly and professional. In flight food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced, I enjoyed the Meat Ploughman's and IPA beer (€10 -/+ total) on both flights I have flown 80+ times in the last 50 years with different airlines on various propeller and jet aircraft as well as one LGW-LHR helicopter transfer. Flying was a totally different experience 'back in the day', we are now in the age of the 'budget airline' Nostalgia aside.. British Airways are the best airline I've flown with.",yes,2023,0.0071400264,0.05333504,0.9395249,2
2023-01-31,Economy Class, Organised boarding process. Really friendly crew. Quick drink and a snack. All in all a great experience. The crew are a credit to BA. The best crew in Europe.,yes,2023,0.0015251563,0.011498116,0.9869767,-1
2023-01-24,First Class," Excellent service both on the ground and on board - while their first class product might not be leading edge, the service around the entire experience was well worth the cost of the ticket. The Concorde room at Heathrow is well managed and a great place to relax prior to the trip. Flight was slightly delayed out of Heathrow but arrived on schedule in Johannesburg.",yes,2023,0.0055853752,0.035734102,0.9586805,-1
2023-01-24,Business Class,  Good lounge at Cape Town. On time departure. Drinks high quality. Sound dinner service. Breakfast reasonable. Arrival lounge was good but showers cold.,yes,2023,0.0044202283,0.05377912,0.94180065,2
2023-01-23,Business Class,"  A really excellent journey. Lounge not overcrowded in late afternoon, plenty of edible food. Easy boarding. New Club World Suites great and compared to when we last travelled in them a year ago food and drink back to previous standards- choice of individual wines rather than bland blends, courses served individually with cut glass and china. Beef cheek really tasty as was a surprisingly good soup. Crew excellent. Good choice of movies. Breakfast after a good night's sleep- fruits etc first, couldn't manage the full English which was offered. Arrival on time. What more could you want? Not quite up to Gulf standards overall, but BA seems to have eventually got its business class back to standard",yes,2023,0.007508193,0.052358195,0.9401336,-1
2023-01-18,Economy Class,"  A rather empty and quiet flight to Tel Aviv, very friendly cabin crew and due to the emptiness of the flight I had an entire row to myself which allowed me to work easily and have as much space as required. Unfortunately upon landing the breaks overheated and we had to wait for the fire crew to cool them down which delayed us. Otherwise an overall excellent flight on BA's part. This was the first time I have flown this flight and it has actually taken off at the correct time.",yes,2023,0.0396765,0.18700296,0.7733205,4
2023-01-17,Business Class,  Easy check in and staff member was polite and helpful and made a specific point of acknowledging our loyalty to BA. Security at London was fast. Galleries North was fine and showers were good. Organised flight boarding. Plane was fine with good crew and new club world product. My wife had a damaged storage area but otherwise ok. After take off there was a good drinks and food service which was well run. Slept well on time arrival. We both found the new seat design harder to sleep in.,yes,2023,0.009798143,0.09229129,0.89791054,-1
2023-01-02,Economy Class,"  BA shuttle service across the UK is still surprisingly a good product. When compared with BA long haul that doesn’t always get the best of comments at times. It’s reasonable priced, works well, fresh crews and no queues or long distances to walk. I don’t know why they still offer a COVID style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack would be great add on for this service. Currently they have an on line sky cafe but it’s too fiddly to work or get connected in short trips.",yes,2023,0.068562046,0.24230742,0.68913054,6
2022-12-24,Economy Class,"  Old A320 with narrow pitch. Flight perfectly on time, with constant announcements from cockpit. Friendly staff, free chips and water. Quick luggage delivery at T5.",yes,2022,0.003912704,0.10736664,0.8887207,4
2022-12-14,Business Class,"  British Airways are not the flag carrier they used to be. The check-in staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service.  The Galleries South Lounge was very busy, but the food was very good. There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate. Despite BA using a group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The cabin was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues. The A321 featured Wi-Fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information, access to the Speedbird Cafe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also. Overall, the airline is still a good world player, but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff. The cabin manager was very good, but the other crew in Club did not display the expected behaviours in business class. She kept touching her face, not making eye contact with passengers, and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there.",yes,2022,0.044483975,0.23198438,0.72353166,2
2022-12-12,Economy Class,  Seat horribly narrow; 3-4-3 on a 777. Thankfully the flight was only a quarter full so was able to stretch out. Food and beverage service was good and it was great having a proper beer not a cup of froth that overflows! Cabin crew very good. Booked as a BA ticket that included travel on Qatar Airways as well.,yes,2022,0.005003328,0.028422581,0.96657413,-1
2022-12-10,Premium Economy,"  When I tried to check in online, I was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under £300. I decided to take it, but then the website wouldn't allow me to choose seats or to check in. I phoned BA and was happy that the call was picked up quickly, but I was then told that because I had changed my booking, I had to check in at the airport. So we turned up three hours before the flight, only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line, we were told to try at the boarding gate. At the gate, we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window, not sitting together. After going through that, the flight was surprisingly good, with decent food and very good service. We flew back economy, which wasn't too bad either. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic, and Emma and Daniel, who looked after us, could not have been better. I've obviously learned my lesson about late BA upgrades, but everything else was good.",yes,2022,0.032450333,0.17174742,0.79580224,-1
2022-11-30,Business Class,"  Booked a BA holiday to Marrakech, after posting a negative review regarding my double tier points credit, I can now confirm that the points have been credited. It took a while but BA did eventually make good on their promise, thank you. Based on things now being resolved I have travelled on BA since and I am booked to travel to South Africa in First class on 2nd January, looking forward to the new BA Concorde lounge. Keep it up BA, loyalty is indeed a 2way street.",yes,2022,0.008392332,0.088046685,0.903561,-1
2022-11-26,Business Class,"  I virtually gave up on British Airways about three years ago, writing off my Avios and opting for other airlines. But my return flights from Heathrow to Lisbon this week were very good. The aircraft were pretty much full, but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good. A particular shout-out to a flight attendant called Jo, but all the teams there and back were enthusiastic and attentive. I'm going to have to start spending those Avios.",yes,2022,0.003927877,0.025427824,0.9706443,6
2022-11-25,Economy Class,"  I was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather. The flight from Montreal was my return flight to Scotland, but I originally booked to fly to and from Toronto, but the airline helped me cancel and I rebooked for a cheaper flight. The inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow. As well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service. While the food was typical air plane food. I thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights.",yes,2022,0.0037412976,0.028414367,0.96784437,-1
2022-10-30,Business Class,"  A great flight. The suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort. British has returned to full service so meals were coursed, menus and hot towels provided…etc Food was quite good with choices provided for both meals. Service was ok, I prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but that’s my preference. Entertainment was good as was connectivity. No real complaints except a minor one. The tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position. I actually felt like I was in a true business class, not by Qatar’s standards, but that’s another story.",yes,2022,0.015379434,0.10734552,0.8772751,4
2022-10-30,Business Class,"  I am happy to say that this flight was quite good. Except for the second rate Euro business seating, everything was very well done. A friendly, informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about Heathrow transit. Well done. Unfortunately, a bus gate was used upon arrival.",yes,2022,0.0064247255,0.026578823,0.96699643,-1
2022-10-24,Business Class,"  A very positive experience with BA. Seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep. Food was fine but not outstanding. Wi-Fi good, and video screen large and bright. Baggage came out very quickly at Heathrow, had the same experience on the return flight to Atlanta. All in all, would fly BA again, but would probably want to make sure it is new seats.",yes,2022,0.005214258,0.046780843,0.9480049,-1
2022-10-17,Economy Class,"  LHR-LAX. I prefer the Boeing 777 over the A380 as the seats don't seem too cramped. Check-in was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at Heathrow. T5 is a whole other story. Once through security its up the escalator, up the stairs, up the elevator, down the escalator get to the gate, no seating, then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane. I have been in and out of Heathrow many times but never in T5 before. Anyway cabin crew were pleasant; drinks and meal service were fine. It was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight. The entertainment system was good with decent options, so I occupied my time with several movies. Nice landing at LAX. All in all BA was just fine.",yes,2022,0.012532495,0.10093566,0.88653183,-1
2022-10-17,Business Class,  I flew with hand baggage but security at Dubai was quick. Entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound. Flight on A380 left on time. Few technical issues with IFE which would have been really irritating had it been a day flight. Decent snack and slept well. Arrivals lounge excellent. Would recommend.,yes,2022,0.08667958,0.24198122,0.6713392,-1
2022-10-15,Business Class,"  This review is specifically about Maddie, crew member who took care of us. She was attentive, warm, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Smiling from start to finish. She should be the brand ambassador for BA.",yes,2022,0.0031406288,0.042119194,0.95474017,3
2022-10-01,Business Class,"  Check in at LHR T5 was very quick and queue for security short. We used the South Lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time, but was very busy and difficult for our group of 3 to get seated together. Flight boarded on time. Whilst this is only a short flight (35 mins) the service of the cabin crew was outstanding. Glass of champagne, Coronation Chicken Salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter. In spite of some of the issues with BA, their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception. Flight landed on time and bags delivered quite promptly.",yes,2022,0.009412395,0.08426802,0.9063196,-1
2022-09-25,Business Class," This is my first time flying BA's new Club Suite, which, in my opinion, is very good. Flight to the US, including mine, departed from concourse C of Terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options. However, it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy. The highlight is the Club Suite, which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy. Meal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at once. I think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre-pandemic standard. At least the food tasted good, which was not something I previously experienced on BA flights, even in First Class.",yes,2022,0.013053494,0.108067185,0.87887937,2
2022-09-23,Premium Economy,"  I would like to thank all the air and cabin crew for having the best experience with a very long journey! I don’t know how you manage to keep smiling. Couldn’t fault anything. Helpful, reassuring, excellent food and I can’t wait to fly again. Thank you and I really appreciated you.",yes,2022,0.002994781,0.008137146,0.988868,3

2022-09-07,Business Class,"  After having a few not so good experiences in the past, I feel I have to write a positive review as well where it is deserved. First of all, the improvement in the BA lounge in Gatwick is massive. The buffet was a joy. We flew on a BA flight but operated by Iberia Express. Wonderful staff and the food was exceptional. Whoever brought in this change of food supplier ... congratulations! Also may I add that this time business class was not 11 rows like last time, but 5 rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service. I am still not clear on luggage being labelled ""priority"". The luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports.",yes,2022,0.045131244,0.16595204,0.7889167,1
2022-08-23,Economy Class,"  I sat in seat 25C. Our Cabin Crew lady was called Gina and she went above and beyond to keep the customers happy. She greeted us as we boarded with a very cheery smile, she engaged with two families travelling with young children and gave out games and books. Her trolley service was excellent and she took great care in what she was doing. She had time for a quick chat and I think she said she was half German and half Bulgarian, a really lovely young lady who is a credit to British Airways.",yes,2022,0.001843054,0.016777294,0.9813797,3
2022-08-23,Economy Class,"  Full afternoon flight. Ready to fly on time. Arrived early. Uneventful flight. Good service. Pre dinner drinks. Drink with meal. Coffee, Drinks available at back.

2022-08-15,Economy Class,"  Barbara Collins was super helpful. My boyfriend & I booked flights separately thinking we were on the same one but we found out at check in that he was on separate, slightly later one. Barbara was able to make some changes to ensure we flew together & even managed to put us sitting together! Much appreciate BA! We had a terrific flight over. Food, drinks & nibbles were great & staff were so friendly. Looking forward to returning home with BA.",yes,2022,0.001774413,0.009668321,0.9885572,-1
2022-08-10,Economy Class,"  My husband, parents who are in their 80’s and I were traveling back to NY from Naples, Italy and had a stopover at Heathrow, London. Let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to London and missed our connecting flight back to NY. The reason writing this review is the great customer service that Kashmir Dhami gave us. She was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day, which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult, but she got it done! She is so kind and is amazing at her job.",yes,2022,0.02025576,0.0614604,0.9182838,3
2022-07-31,Premium Economy,"  We had a nice flight. pushed-off exactly on time. Cabin crew very efficient in all things; friendly for the most part as well. Dinner (hot!) and complimentary wine served in premium economy very good. Do avoid middle seats though, even in premium economy. Only issue was with indifferent/non-helpful BA call center who refused to honor one world status to select seat choice in advance. Nice start to a 3 week trip to England.",yes,2022,0.031756446,0.099371,0.8688725,4
2022-07-23,Business Class,"  Flight on A380 SFO to LHR. Smooth check in at San Francisco. Airport quiet and efficient. Dedicated BA lounge, excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff. Lounge was very crowded though. Minor departure delay and onto A380 upper deck. I prefer the club world cabin on the upper deck as it is very much quieter. Old style product but clean and well maintained. Staff offered a good level of service and reasonable meals. On time arrival, baggage quite slow. A good flight overall.",yes,2022,0.007523531,0.08981499,0.90266144,-1
2022-07-17,Economy Class, Routine typical BA domestic shuttle flight. Nothing special. Departure five minutes early but no one to greet flight upon arrival hence a 30 minute delay. Crew were attentive and charming. Usual clean cut BA product that when it works well is fine.,yes,2022,0.0396972,0.28154415,0.6787586,-1
2022-07-09,Business Class,"  Check in and security at LHR efficient. Went to Galleries North which was busy but fine with good service. Left from B gates. Efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus. This was my first time on the club suite. Travelling with 2 children. BA moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in. It was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy. I liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. The entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good. On time arrival, prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. We don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise. Overall a good flight.",yes,2022,0.01754462,0.11566989,0.8667855,2

2022-06-06,Economy Class,"  I travelled on the 11th April with my baby in economy class, flight BA 2260 and BA 2508. I had the pleasure of meeting Sarah air stewardess. She was absolutely amazing. I received great service from her along with other staff but more importantly she went above and beyond. It was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated. She repeatedly asked if I needed anything as I had Arham in my lap most of the time. She held him whilst I had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft. We had a chat and the service was just amazing. It is something I will never forget. Thank you for being there and for all your support throughout the flight. I have worked in aviation but the job you do is remarkable and under appreciated. Hope you see this.",yes,2022,0.0026069349,0.009165391,0.98822767,3
2022-06-03,Business Class,"  Outstanding inflight service from the crew. Friendly, professional and helpful. The very best of British. Even though the departure was delayed due to chaos among ground staff at Vancouver, it didn’t matter. The crew made the flight outstanding.",yes,2022,0.012095626,0.057494286,0.9304101,-1
2022-06-02,Economy Class,"  Recent trip to Boston, departing LHR T5. Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US, they were really friendly and personable. Very short queues for bag drop and security, I would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the UK at the moment. Boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. Seated on the last row of economy I really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. Myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. Considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the IFE box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. The cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that you very rarely see in economy. The food by DO&CO was exceptional, I don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-Atlantic flight in economy. It will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out-station. Overall it was a great flight, helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by BA which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere. I would definitely consider flying with them again.",yes,2022,0.0050623473,0.034637094,0.9603006,-1
2022-05-09,Premium Economy,"  This flight was not affected by recent problems with BA and I was quite impressed by the British Airways Premium Economy product in a new Boeing 787. Overall, Premium Economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from Economy towards Business Class. Also, the Premium Economy product came across much better in the Boeing 787 than in the old B747 or even than in the B777. Seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room. Food, service and entertainment options were good. Clearly worth the extra money for Premium Economy.",yes,2022,0.0017196842,0.018533673,0.9797466,-1

2022-04-29,Economy Class,  I would like to thank you for the great service. I am a handicap and my family and I were afraid of this trip because I was flying alone and had a layover in London of a few hours. I had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing.

2022-04-28,Business Class," I connected into Madrid on Iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service. British Airways short haul business class was in a totally different class. The cabin had 10 rows of seats in BC, a record for me. The staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight. The messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent. The food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff. Why, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? My thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company. British Airways keep up the good work, (it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your European competitors) overall you made me feel proud to be a Brit.",yes,2022,0.114946984,0.26292038,0.62213266,2
2022-04-27,Business Class,"  We flew from Dubrovnik to Heathrow on the 24th April 2022. Check in was very fast and we cleared security in about 15 minute, we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was clean and spacious. When boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board, welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes, once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off. Once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services, choice of 3 main meal options which was very good, served by very friendly crew, the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at Heathrow slightly early.

2022-04-20,Business Class,"  My first time in the new Club World suite. Excellent, lots of space and privacy, very good seat. I doubt if this can be bettered. Good staff as ever.

2022-04-14,Economy Class,"  The service was very good, the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this size. The seat was comfortable for economy and because the A380 walls are still expanding outwards on the first floor, there was a lot of space. The food was good for airplane food. The only bad thing was the ife screen was quite outdated and wasn't good quality, however there was a large selection of movies and TV shows",yes,2022,0.039433755,0.13792144,0.8226448,4

2022-04-06,Business Class,"  New Club Suites are amazing, the only let down is the bed is a little too firm but the pillow was the most comfortable pillow I have ever used. Food was ok as I have had better on BA in the past and I can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is OK. The cabin crew were brilliant but I was surprised that after dinner the crew didn’t once come round with beverages or even bottled water. BA really have a great hard product here and I would suspect the soft product will improve once Covid restrictions become less of an issue. Well done BA.",yes,2022,0.012567253,0.050073013,0.9373598,2
2022-04-02,Business Class,"  Flew to Barbados 16 March on BA 255 in the new Club Class suite. A huge improvement on the old yin and yang Club Class which we unfortunately endured on the way back. Comfortable, big TV screen with high quality picture and good headphones, plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private. Nice friendly FA's (called by my name from the off) and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served. Once again let down by a poor (at best) choice of movies on the in-flight entertainment system. Thank goodness the latest James Bond movie was showing. Took off and landed on time. Smooth flight. Only one letdown - the usual extortionate fee charged for pre-booking a seat. Come on BA, stop nickel and diming - it spoils what could be a really good Business Class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege. I recommend with the usual caveats.",yes,2022,0.13412312,0.23945339,0.62642354,-1
2022-02-28,Premium Economy,"  Outstanding! From the warm, smiling welcome on board, this flight was excellent. The in flight crew were friendly, attentive and very professional. Detailed announcements from the flight deck as well. Food and wine all very good indeed. The Premium Economy product on BA is also very good. Comfortable seats, foot and leg rests and decent recline.

2022-02-19,Business Class,  Check in at IAD was quick and easy. Lounge in Washington was a BA lounge and very good. Sound pre flight food offerings for this overnight flight.

On time arrival and quickly made it to T5 arrivals lounge which was excellent.,yes,2022,0.0025963492,0.036525268,0.96087843,2
2022-02-13,Business Class,"  BA got everything right. Allowed evening before check in , this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the US. On the day of travel it was half term and the Airport busy. In spite of this through security and into lounge in 5 minutes. Lounge clean, staff proactive and food served quickly. Good range of drinks. Easy transfer to C gates. Aircraft ready, boarding quick and well organised. Pre departure drinks served. The cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service. The food was the new club world menu options ( roast beef) which was excellent. Although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained. On time arrival, baggage off very fast. Overall an excellent flight and it feels like BA are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use COVID as an excuse for service cut backs Well done",yes,2022,0.0059837354,0.050568122,0.9434482,2
2022-02-08,Business Class,"  This past November/December I flew Washington-London return and, on the strength of that trip (my first in two years), the inflight service quality appears to have pretty much returned to the pre-pandemic status quo ante. The cabin was clean and well maintained, seats were comfortable, food and drinks were good (including a very tasty Hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg), and the BA cabin crews remain the best in the business. This was one of a number of bookings that I had to re-book a number of times due to flight cancellations, and contrary to the experience of many here, my re-bookings were handled courteously and thoroughly (although I did have a number of lengthy waits on hold, but under the present circumstances that's to be expected). It's good to see that the everyday product has held up so well amid this dreadful time, and I'm looking forward to future trips on BA.",yes,2022,0.010189301,0.05239281,0.9374179,3
2022-02-08,Economy Class,"  I had the best experience I have ever had with an airline. Our initial flight to Dubai was canceled By Royal air Maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute. I found that booking with them was extremely simple. Unfortunately, we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure. I called the customer service, waited about 20 minutes before I could speak with someone and within 15 minutes, the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund. The person on the line was extremely nice, understanding and willing to help us. I had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline. I got the full refund on my credit card the day after. I usually chose the cheapest flight ticket, regardless of the airline, but from now on, I’ll definitely make sure to check with British airways first.",yes,2022,0.052671097,0.14652213,0.80080676,6
2022-02-01,Business Class," BA cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day later. We had no issue with this, just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible. However, they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from LHR and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at ATL. The aircraft was newish and in excellent condition, flight was around 50% capacity. Service was excellent, staff were friendly and efficient. Dinner was good, breakfast was disappointing with little choice. The LHR to BHD leg was equally good and I am beginning to think that BA are getting their mojo back again.",yes,2022,0.020011008,0.095651425,0.8843376,3
2022-01-10,Economy Class,"  I used British Airways for the first time and I have to admit that I am impressed with their service! Firstly, I want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage. My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived at the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. Diversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it was different.  The staff was very kind and friendly as well. What a wonderful experience to fly with these guys!",yes,2022,0.035898454,0.08676237,0.8773391,3
2022-01-02,Business Class," After two years of being unable to fly to our second home in South Africa because of COVID, it was fantastic to be back on board a BA flight to CPT, and in the Club Suite seats (1K and 2K) to boot. These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time. CPT had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration. It was good to be back!",yes,2022,0.041144785,0.1646179,0.7942374,2
2021-12-29,Business Class," Very nice return flight with BA. To add to my previous review, I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed. Lovely humus, beetroot and quinoa salad for food. Great WiFi at really competitive pricing + I think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes. Domestic T5 arrivals is a breeze.",yes,2021,0.0033061695,0.018576505,0.97811735,4
2021-12-28,Business Class,"  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.",yes,2021,0.05691916,0.16316332,0.77991754,2
2021-12-27,Economy Class,"  Flying during covid is always a challenge. BA’s VeriFLY app worked perfectly and on-line check-in was seamless. The bags drop at T5 was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones. Although an older 777 it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean. The cabin crew were a credit to the airline – smartly dressed, friendly and keen to please. We were offered two drinks before lunch was served, with more drinks with the meal. The food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing. Obviously it was only economy but, after 8 hours flying, I arrived relaxed and unstressed.",yes,2021,0.007619445,0.082777604,0.909603,2
2021-12-24,First Class,"  Flew to Nashville via Chicago in first. Excellent check in and security. Lounge was good. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats.

2021-11-24,Business Class," Arrived at the South airport in Tenerife 2 hours before departure, Iberia had not opened the check in. Even with a full flight waiting, the usual check in process post COVID took place, with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down. Passing security was fine and Iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food. Boarding was done by a 15 meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate. Not sure why. The plane was a very new A321 neo, with 14 rows of club seating. The seat was ok for a 4 hour flight, but anything longer and I would expect club Europe to have more leg room than the couple of inch’s between my knee and the seat in front. Food and drink where very good, served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers. Good selection of wine to go with a above average salad. Overall it was an OK experience with a great cabin crew.",yes,2021,0.020792356,0.16549549,0.8137121,2
2021-11-06,Economy Class, Another BA shuttle flight and a good one. Fantastic flying weather and I would say a 40% load factor. Good professional crew. Friendly and complimentary snack arrived early so now worries. And getting to the A gates at T5 makes for an easy exit. Still a cut above their competitors although a bit more expensive they make up for that in total product delivery.,yes,2021,0.008584883,0.06084787,0.93056726,4
2021-10-29,Premium Economy," Club Europe on British Airways. Outstanding and wonderful to have BA back. The welcome on board was warm and sincere.

2021-10-23,Business Class,"  Check in was easy, security quick, lounge fine. Lounge service returning to pre pandemic days and some self service allowed (which was great). Flight was fine, my wife and son felt breakfast was more like old style economy food and perhaps I agree. There was nothing bad about food but nothing great either. Drinks were fine and proactively served. On arrival efficient PCR testing where it was needed and fast turnaround. Baggage off quick",yes,2021,0.010116751,0.09587908,0.89400417,2
2021-10-20,Economy Class,"  I have just returned from an amazing holiday and felt compelled to write a review. The flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer, however, on this occasion it was an absolute delight. On both inward and outward journeys, I was impressed by the professionalism, friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew. I was in economy but was treated with the respect and service I would expect in the first class cabin. My particular thanks must go to Amir, who was absolute joy and a credit to British Airways. I cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge, Thank you so so much.",yes,2021,0.0078500705,0.020851405,0.9712985,3

2021-10-07,Business Class," LCA to LHR in Club Europe. Quick check-in at LCA with speedy passport control and security. Aspire lounge was clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drink. Boarding by group and pushback on time. CE stretched back a full 15 rows and the single toilet struggled. Drinks and meal service was efficient despite the many rows, but the vegetarian option was the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yore. Onboard W-Fi was adequate, if rather slow, and it shouldn't be charged for in business class. Arrival ahead of schedule. Disembarking en masse and through e-gates surprisingly quickly. Overall, a flight that was typical of the post-COVID standard for short-haul business class.",yes,2021,0.020427473,0.28508013,0.69449234,2

2021-09-21,Business Class,"  Very pleasant flight to Lisbon! It was a full flight and we left about 10min late as we were taken to the aircraft by bus at Heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft. However, in the air great service by the 3 male crew on a big Club class cabin. Friendly and efficient crew even to some demanding and obnoxious passengers. Late breakfast/brunch served was tasty. What a contrast to the Iberia crew (Lisbon/Madrid/London) who were cold and unprofessional.",yes,2021,0.03550795,0.13314573,0.83134633,-1
2021-08-22,Economy Class,  I flew on British Airways Cheapest Fare which was a Hand Baggage Only fare in Economy Class. Despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to 23KG each. The value for money here is incredible. The ground staff at London Heathrow are very polite and helpful. The plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite. This was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water. There was Wifi onboard which we paid £11.99 for the full flight access package and it was great. It was fast enough to stream a movie on Netflix. If you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like BA pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier. With the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands.,yes,2021,0.0029579592,0.03146423,0.96557784,-1

2021-06-13,Business Class,"  Aktion airport has only recently opened its new facilities and check-in and departure certainly seemed very clean and efficient, although admittedly it’s only having to cope with a low passenger load at present. It was good to see that check-in carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms. Thanks to just 30 passengers on board, with more than half in Club Europe, the flight took off ahead of time. Service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class, with too much pre-packaging - the COVID effect, presumably. Arrival into T5 was also comfortably ahead of schedule, and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control, we were through the e-gates and collecting our luggage just 20 minutes after landing.",yes,2021,0.01568097,0.13517591,0.8491431,2

2021-05-30,Business Class," After sixteen months of being grounded by COVID, it felt almost surreal to be back in T5, heading for what to us was essential summer sun in Greece. T5 was blissfully quiet, with no queues at check-in or security, and even the Galleries South lounge was less frenetic than usual, despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape Boris Johnson’s bully boy attitude. Ordering food and beverages from one’s table seems something worth continuing, avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffets. The flights was very quiet, with just 30 pax on board, 9 of whom were in Club Europe. Boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous ‘groups’. Service on the flight was good and the food was of the usual Do&Co quality. Landing was ahead of schedule and we were through passport control in just a few minutes after a quick check of vaccination certificates and the passenger locator form.

2020-12-27,Economy Class,"  Good service the whole way. Nothing exceptional but it was only a short flight. Plane was clean and refreshments were provided. My only issue is that the flight was packed - understandable as it was just before Chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close to each other during a pandemic, even with the masks? My return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either - just hoping for a little more personal space next time! Also wi-fi did not work. I also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time, brought in for the pandemic I'm sure but I hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant. Value for money marked down only because the Christmas flights were so expensive! To be expected though, I know.",yes,2020,0.114219844,0.26959538,0.6161848,2

2020-12-25,Economy Class,"  I was supposed to fly with Aeroflot on the 23rd of December to Moscow. But because Russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and I couldn’t get home. I’ve also tried to fly through Antalya, but the same situation occurred. On my third try, I came to Heathrow and tried to fly away to Cairo. I was declined by another company. Then I went to British Airways. Starting from testing (because Egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (I’m not sure is it connected to BA, but still, I want to mention this). The crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for this. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. I’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. After I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare the details). However, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. The nicest lady I’ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn’t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can’t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven’t met them. I don’t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! For some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do. However, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise.

2020-12-07,Business Class," This is my first flight since January. We have had three cancellations which BA handled superbly. But this flight went ahead. Check in at LHR was fine, no fast track se unity at T5. Galleries South lounge open, they have an app system, it seemed to work well and my breakfast arrived quickly. Followed this with a shower (they are open-limited hours). Flight on time and well presented A321. Staff worked hard, nice drinks run, the packed lunch was not dissimilar to the old short haul economy product but was fine in these times. Landed on time, priority baggage cane off late.

2020-10-22,Economy Class,"  Overall I have to say I am really pleased with the service BA provided, given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines. I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10. Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. That's fine on the first day after (yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled. Overall my experience with BA was very positive though and I am happy to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service I received.",yes,2020,0.026490033,0.13454072,0.8389692,-1

2020-09-23,Business Class,"  I have always had great flights with British Airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing! As this was my 100th flight, I decided to celebrate it in Club Europe, which turned out to be a perfect decision. The stewards working in Club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty. Although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight, other features didn’t let me down either. Efficient business class check in at Warsaw, cosy executive lounge Preludium with attentive and helpful staff, well organised boarding (although no priority for Club Europe because of Corona). The aircraft was very fresh and clean. Seats were comfortable with enough legroom, adjustable headrests and power ports. The on board service is different than before Corona times but it’s still very good. Tasty lunch box from DO&CO with fresh chicken sandwich, oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse. The choice of drinks was wide, including a very good quality Champagne from Nicolas Feuillatte. All in all a perfect flight experience with British Airways. Everything I expected from this flight was fulfilled. The one thing I can complain about is baggage handling at Heathrow. We waited around 50 mins for luggage and they were also delivered irrespecutful of Club Europe priority.",yes,2020,0.0076815058,0.044393044,0.9479254,2

I was also excited to fly on an A350 for the first time and it definitely lived up to my expectations. The breakfast buffet in the BA lounge in Heathrow T5 was okay not amazing and there was a good range of drinks and comfortable settees. The aircraft felt very clean and fresh and had good mood lighting, very comfortable spacious seats and large high-resolution IFE screens. I like the moving map but my wife opted for the movies and was impressed with the selection available. We both enjoyed the food and wines on board and it was a professional and friendly service from the cabin crew.

The check-in and security were very efficient and the lounge (not belonging to BA) was clean but had a more limited range of food than I would have expected. Boarding was very quick and cabin crew were friendly and professional. I am a big fan of the iconic 747 but we flew out on one of BA's new A350's and this brought home to me that the 747 business class is looking tired and old in comparison. The seats were comfortable and the food was good but small and very low quality IFE screen was behind the times.

2020-04-19,Economy Class,"  London-Heathrow to Warsaw on 14th March. British Airways stands out in many areas of the flight experience, starting from check in and ending on the deplaning. Very friendly, smiling, chatty people throughout my journey, including the lovely captain, who gave all the information about delay, missed slot and new departure time. What is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times, he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us, this aircraft is so modern and has such good air filters that we are safe here. The boarding procedure was very well organised (no chaos) with 5 groups boarding sequentially. I didn't try the paid Marks&Spencer on board service but I think it would be a nice touch to get some refreshments free. The one thing I can pick on is the cleanliness of the rear toilet. Whilst the rest of the cabin was impeccably clean, the toilet was filthy. ",yes,2020,0.016336983,0.084612004,0.899051,5
2020-03-08,Economy Class,"  London to Beijing in January 2020. BA has really upped their game now. A few years back I took BA, the experience was really disappointed and avoid them since However, my recent flight is good. The flight was delayed for 1 hour due to mechanical reasons, but get back majority of the delay in the air. Food is tasty, and crews are not hesitate to provide more if you are still hungry. The drinks are offered in the promote manner, and crews are really willing to engage with you (in the gallery when majority of the passengers fall asleep). Seat is a bit tight but understood I am flying economy so this is bearable The return flight has been cancelled, it takes like 10 calls / emails, and they finally sorted out our flight.

2020-03-05,Economy Class,"  London to Delhi. This booking was part of a holiday group format so we had to check in as opposed to bag drop. According to the check in screen, all zones were applicable for our destination, but we were sent from one zone to the next; (which, given the size of the T5 check in hall wasn't helpful) Eventually, we managed to find assistance but it was very much a shrug of the shoulder attitude - especially when we discovered we were seated separately; it was only when a family with two young children had been split up that we were able to switch seats. Fortunately, the cabin crew made up for this by providing a fabulous flight, with great service and positive, friendly attitude.

From the warm welcome at the door on boarding until deplaning at LHR, the crew were outstanding. Friendly, attentive and professional. The dinner was excellent. Excellent choices on the menu, accompanied by some decent wines. I had a painful back from running. A flight attendant provided some medication, came back to my seat an hour or so later to check on me and remembered to ask me if the pain had subsided when I deplaned. Very thoughtful. Seat was comfortable and complemented by a proper cushion and a very nice quilted blanket. IFE good.

A good experience onboard one of BAs recently refreshed A321 cabins, although unfortunately without any in-seat power supply, contrary to what is stated on their website about which aircraft types were due to get in-seat power following refresh. Another thing to add to the list of inconsistencies with the BA product. However the flight overall was very good. As usual an extremely efficient pre-flight experience at Heathrow's excellent T5. Fast track security was fast, as expected. Galleries Club Lounge was pretty good, and not too crowded. Boarding was smooth with priority boarding honoured as usual. The crew were excellent and provided a very attentive service, with plently of drinks runs given the slightly longer distance of the flight. The food pretty good for a shorthaul business class offering. I found the seats to be pretty comfortable and legroom reasonable for a 5 ft 11"" chap.

With tears in my eyes I went to the desk where they sell tickets and the employee was so kind and helpful - she booked me on to the next flight for free, got me through security without having to wait in the line and she informed the flight crew what happened. When I finally sat down the flight crew were so kind and gave me water and food as I haven't had any food for the whole day as I didn't have any money.

The new menus and service offering are significantly better than in the past and the wine list more interesting. On this flight the crew were engaging and the food was good.

Professional crew with beams on their faces, new aircraft (it's important to choose a seat no further than row 14 in A321neo, as those seats are the old type Pinnacle seats and have better legroom), very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off (very much appreciated), on time landing and good atmosphere on board! The food in Euro Traveller is unfortunately no longer free, however being in BA's Executive Club you can pay for the food & drinks with avios, which is very convenient. The only drawback I could find is a long queue to the bag check-in at Warsaw Airport - 3 opened check-in counters for approx. 200 people is rather not enough.",yes,2020,0.08289407,0.26179832,0.6553076,-1

2020-01-14,Economy Class,"  Overall a very comfortable flight with British Airways. Both of my flights took off on time and reached on time. I was really excited to fly BA since they changed the aircraft from Boeing 777-200 to a Boeing 747-400 which is known as the queen of the skies.  The flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers, they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off. Everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds. On my second flight to Mumbai, the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service. However, during the lunch service, they ran out of vegetarian food option and had to fetch for vegetarian food in other cabins and even give crew meals to passengers who were vegetarian. Overall, my both flights with BA were good. There are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of USB ports, Power Outlet, Old IFE, the IFE box in front of you that blocks your legroom.  BA  need to refurbish their old cabins on Boeing 777-200 and Boeing 747,if they still plan to use them on longer flights.",yes,2020,0.023822377,0.1219333,0.8542443,3
2020-01-11,Business Class," 
Fantastic flight. Travelled solo from London Gatwick to Glasgow in British Airway’s Club Europe cabin and could not fault one aspect of the service. I arrived at Gatwick around 2 hours prior to departure. All BA Club World passengers are entitled to fast track security at Gatwick. This was quick and the staff were pleasant enough. The lounge at Gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey. Boarding was quick and the flight departed on-time and landed 10 minutes early, the crew were very attentive and friendly. The in-flight meal was delicious (I had smoked Salmon served with curried rice). Overall a really lovely flying experience. Had there been ever-so-slightly more leg room and in-flight entertainment I’d have given this flight 10/10!

2020-01-11,Business Class,"  Rio De Janeiro to London Heathrow. Love this aircraft, only a 3 Class, Business, World Traveller Plus and Economy Class. 2 Cabins in Business class Front 3 rows and Rear 2 Rows. I had seat 3A, In my opinion the seat, Window seat with a bit more space than the usual seat (at 6'4'' a little extra helps) very private tucked behind second galley area, toilet is over the other side J/K. I settled in to sleep and did not have an evening meal. Crew very accommodating as they offered water bottles immediately. A good few hours sleep as normal and woke up about 10 minutes before breakfast. I really enjoyed the fruit, yoghurt, muesli and the full English Breakfast. All in all great service, Good flight and felt fully relaxed.",yes,2020,0.0029486374,0.025205607,0.97184575,-1
2020-01-11,Business Class," Keflavik to London Heathrow. Cabin crew were amazing. Weather was terrifying as we drove to the airport so we knew things were going to be tough. Expecting a delay and seeing other European flights were cancelled we expected the same but then were surprised to see our flight boarding. Snow in blizzard conditions, we were surprised but got settled in our seats. Crew very friendly and a long story short after 3 hours on the ground waiting for the di-icing machine we finally made our way to take off. All the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each one and personally looked at their options the BA online app to help them. Non-alcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time. The first officer kept us informed all the time that is was not BA fault that the de-icing machine was delayed so much eventually procedures done we were ready for take-off. How the pilot and team managed this in these conditions I will never now but it was a smooth take off an when through the clouds a smooth journey all the way back to Heathrow. Cabin crew provided excellent service. Being business we were lucky to have champagne and our meals were excellent. Veg shepherds pie and chicken curry both lovely. So just want to thank you BA. We know you get a lot of negative reviews but this is to say we can't fault you. Particularly the crew who made a real effort to talk to all of us. Well done.",yes,2020,0.019869702,0.09146573,0.8886646,5
2020-01-03,Business Class,"  London Heathrow to Rio De Janeiro. Not the usual aircraft for this route but it is one of my favourites, this aircraft today has a First Class but was flown empty as it usually only offers Club World. Flight not full, Seated in 7F aisle seat, no one in the middle seat so very pleasant. It is away from the Toilet over at 7A/B but next to galley area which was great as it is a day flight. Food (pre-ordered) was very good as usual, plenty of drinks offered crew very keen to assist, again nothing any trouble at all. I did watch some films but I had already been on a previous BA Long Haul so was not really looking for much. I had some rest as it was a long day and I getting a cold! Arrived late due to a technical problem at Heathrow, they managed to fix the problem on the taxiway to the runway but after an hour I must say I didn't really need to be told they were trying to fix the problem rather than return to the departure gate. All in all another very good flight.",yes,2020,0.010901471,0.05605923,0.93303925,-1

Highlight on the TLS-LHR sector a (£5.50) celebratory treat with mince pie, christmas cake, brandy butter which combined with a G&T hit the spot. You could argue it should be free but I’m not complaining.  I do miss the BA quality of service, but compared to the ME airlines you’re still pretty good.",yes,2019,0.019632658,0.11961331,0.860754,-1

2019-12-13,Business Class," London to San Francisco. This flight was a delight. Friendly, relaxed crew, good food and wine and a main deck Club World cabin that was nearly empty. If you manage your expectations with BA Club World and everything goes as it should then you shouldn't be disappointed. Yes the rollout of the new Club World Suite has been a long time coming however the food service has improved considerably - BA are trying valiantly to regain their long gone moniker of ""World's Favourite Airline"". The 747 has seen better days however given they're being removed from most airline's passenger services, you should take the opportunity to fly one before they're gone. I'm gradually regaining my confidence in BA.",yes,2019,0.008070048,0.0752637,0.9166662,6
2019-12-10,Business Class,"  London to Singapore. I was apprehensive about flying BA Club World after reading many negative reviews. I was however, surprised. Firstly, they are not on part with SQ or QR - but to be fair, I found them to be one of the most reasonably priced offerings. You get what you pay for. The seat while old, is perfectly comfortable with plenty of space. The window seats are best for privacy. I am tall and had no issues sleeping. In fact, I slept for almost 7 hours. The service and food out of London was top notch, fresh and plentiful, which is a welcome contrast to the tiny meals you receive on Qantas. Service was consistent, polite and very attentive. Drinks and water continually topped up. I was truly impressed The return flight's service was very average and quite sloppy but let’s focus on the positives!",yes,2019,0.016980335,0.072122075,0.9108976,-1
2019-12-08,First Class,"  London Heathrow to Miami. Flying the Boeing 747-400. Unfortunately BA hasn't done much work on their first class on these aircraft. Seats are flat bed but you have that wedge in the front that even for my 6'1"" makes the beds small. And since it's so narrow your feet get clamped if you sleep on your side. These seats are Business class on for example Qatar Airways. And I still think a first class ticket should include WiFi! But as always the service excel and the crew are so friendly and helpful.

2019-12-08,Economy Class," London to Sydney via Singapore. Flight left on time cabin crew where fantastic. Meals were great. Leaving London we had a chicken stir fry and landing into Singapore at 18:00 we were served an English breakfast which I can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd. At Singapore, all passengers had to disembark the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean. When re-boarding you had to go through a security check at the gate. We were on the ground in Singapore for 1hour 30min. 2nd leg to Sydney was great also food and drink service was great again. 23 hours long haul flight was comfortable.

2019-11-12,Economy Class," Tirana to London Gatwick. I fly British Airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while I almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. We boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. While the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. In fact, the Wi-Fi package I got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as I am 1.88 cm tall. Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast, but I managed well. The flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we de-boarded quickly. I always recommend BA - and will continue to do so.",yes,2019,0.007649312,0.041902464,0.9504483,1

On-time departure and swift meal services, nothing was any trouble at all and the flight was full. Easy access to the club kitchen after meal service and great entertainment, I have found this flight great and love the inbound day time flight to London the easiest to travel on.

Not very tasty. The breakfast was scrambled eggs with mushrooms, fruit and a muffin, it was delicious! The cabin crew was ok. Not bad, not excellent. We arrived on time and was a great flight.

2019-10-09,Business Class," Dubai to London Heathrow. I flew on the A350 on one of its first trips and will be flying it again. On the same multi segment trip I tried SQ business class and EK business class (and sadly the old BA business class on an aging B777) on overnight trips. The new ""business suite"" offering from BA is the best business class I have experienced. I am a BA Gold card holder and the experience was outstanding. The First lounge at DXB was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks. Food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue. On board the new suite was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in. The bed was very comfortable. Food choices were very limited (soup and sandwiches) although this did suit the timing of the flight. I would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers. Whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers I don't know, but I certainly could work very effectively in my suite. Downside is the IFE is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product.",yes,2019,0.028853267,0.0961295,0.8750172,-1

Onboard the flight, the steward gave me hot water and milk so that I can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me. While waiting to get off the plane, I had a wonderful conversation with the BA staff who are so pleasant. I love flying with BA and we will continue to do so.

The seats are great and service was very friendly on this leg (less so on the return). A few areas need improvement: 1) Separate toilets from economy 2) Dedicated crew for the premium economy section rather than added onto their economy service. 3) A better 2nd meal - The main meal was great and noticeably more premium however the next meal (breakfast) was a bit of an afterthought.

2019-09-28,Business Class," We have had some torrid experiences with BA - which we have not been shy to report. So when we flew yesterday with them from Heathrow to Austin and had a great flight in every way, it felt right to feedback on that. The staff in the upstairs business class cabin were, frankly, wonderful. Cheerful, efficient and calm. What more could you ask? The food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely. The beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy. I literally cannot think of any real negatives. The luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it. If only BA could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion, they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’. Sadly, the current CEO doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful. Perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better. Although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time. As we entered the (literally empty) immigration area, we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine, who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars! Surreal, as anyone who regularly travels to the States, will testify! It felt as if we were living in the Truman Show at one point but in the nicest possible way. Get yourselves down to good ole Austin now that BA fly there direct. Fantastic.",yes,2019,0.068801954,0.19486137,0.73633665,3
2019-09-28,Business Class," London Heathrow to Austin with British Airways. It was a little bit like going back in time to fly upper deck on a 747 to Austin. But, it was the most enjoyable flight we’ve taken for a long time. It was so quiet on our deck and we had a fantastic flight crew who couldn’t do enough for you, and always with a smile. We arrived as fresh as you can from 10 hours in the air, on time, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The only slight issue was the very IFE systems and small overhead lockers.

2019-09-26,Business Class," The start of our journey back from from EFL was inauspicious, with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge, awaiting flights on airlines other than BA. As it was, weather in the UK plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes. Once airborne in a refitted A320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in CE were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable. It was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. A big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour's use. I thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently not. Landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights. However, BA had laid on a separate bus for CE passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later. So, not too bad, all in all.",yes,2019,0.046107024,0.2201537,0.7337393,-1

The Galleries Lounge in Terminal 5 at Heathrow was very busy with limited seats available. Boarding for the second flight began on time and departure swift. The inflight service was top notch with a very capable crew looking after the customers on the upper deck in a professional and discrete manner. Food was plentiful and tasty, entertainment perfectly adequate and seat comfort fine. No complaints at all about the flight and would recommend British Airways.",yes,2019,0.0038475627,0.06750046,0.928652,0
2019-09-11,Economy Class,"  London to Gothenburg. BA are getting a lot of bad press - deservedly so at present with strikes, IT glitches, baggage problems. However extreme cases will always be highlighted. Two recent flights on BA, and very happy with them. Flight to Gothenburg on A319-100, pushed back 25m late due to a potential technical issue, soon resolved and arrived at GOT only 15m behind schedule. Good crew and the Safety Announcement video was a hoot. Return to LHR on A320-232. On time departure and early arrival at T5. Again good crew. Will be flying with BA again in December (strikes permitting). Still recommended by me as the National Carrier.",yes,2019,0.048793163,0.2247855,0.72642136,0
2019-09-08,Business Class,"  Glasgow to Tampa via Gatwick. Early morning flight Glasgow to Gatwick. Flight dud take off at 6.45. Boarded with doors closed by 6.30 bug did not depart till 7.10 due to Gatwick being busy, smooth flight down. Gatwick to Tampa, according to manage my booking, aircraft changed 2 days prior to departure. At boarding was told our World Traveller plus seats had been upgraded to Club World, a very pleasant surprise. If was on 777 which had not been refurbished, extra space was very good, staff were very efficient and pleasant. Only downside was the main meal, which I would have had in original seats, but main courses were not to my liking, but afternoon tea was very good. So thank you BA for the experience.",yes,2019,0.014968659,0.084443,0.9005884,1
2019-09-06,Economy Class,"  London to Abu Dhabi. This is the daytime flight from London. A very good flight. The food was excellent for economy (particularly in view of Etihad‘s disastrous changes in food service). The children’s meals were excellent. The entertainment system was great with a good selection. It makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate, especially when flying with children (Etihad, why don’t you do this?). The cabin crew were good. Economy in the 787 is cramped but probably no worse than many. Good value flight, especially as the only other carrier to Abu Dhabi is Etihad.",yes,2019,0.04244651,0.114124365,0.84342915,-1
2019-08-29,Economy Class,"  I had a stress free journey with my 8 yr old autistic son and 6 yr old girl from Chennai to London by British airways. The Chennai Ground Service Manager recogonised my sunflower lanyard and came forward to help me throughout the services right from pushing my trolley, screening the luggage, checking through the security without much stress and finally boarding the aircraft as the second person. I am stunned by the service and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey really really smooth. Thank you so much. Inside the aircraft the crew members did come forward and asked if I need any help, and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first person for him to see me with lanyard. I did even use the disabled way to clear my immigration at Heathrow airport. Over all i am happy to say that my trip with my kids has been really smooth with BA and Heathrow airport. #happyautism# Thank you",yes,2019,0.0045020087,0.030517038,0.9649809,3
2019-08-28,Economy Class,  Edinburgh to Kuala Lumpur via London. I have just returned to KL from an extended visit in UK seeing family and friends. My return flight was BA033 from Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur on Monday 26th August 2019 at 21.10. I was greeted by the most delightful air hostess whose name I didn't quite catch. The point I wish to make is that she looked after me so well on the flight. She was exceptional. It really made the journey one of the best on board experiences I have had. ,yes,2019,0.0016031315,0.012129501,0.9862673,0
2019-08-25,First Class,"  London to Shanghai. The Concorde room in Heathrow Terminal 5 was amazing, the dinner experience was great and the food was delicious. However, the First galleries was overcrowded and the buffet was bad. On the plane, the crew was very friendly and nice. Dinner service was finished 1 hour after take off, the food was okay. Bed was made after dinner and it was very comfortable, perhaps the best I have had. The entertainment system was not as good as other airlines like Qatar Airlines and Emirates. Overall, the journey was great.",yes,2019,0.010345608,0.043574605,0.94607973,0
2019-08-24,Economy Class,"  Good morning. I would like to write a review for British Airways. It took me a while to write this review as I it took me a while to get over what happened to me. But I feel that the way British Airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts. Last year I went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to New Orleans from London on the holiday of a life time. I was pregnant at the time. The baby died while I was on holiday there and I was in a turmoil of emotions. Regardless I tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on, all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in England. Somehow I missed the flight back. I have no excuse for this. When I realised I was in a complete state. I had a break down. I rang BA and sobbed down the phone. They were beyond amazing! They arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost. We all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and I was in hospital the day afterwards. Customer service was outstanding. So compassionate and helpful. And again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights. I am beyond grateful for their help. I will only ever fly BA on long haul if possible.",yes,2019,0.08166203,0.21416697,0.704171,3
2019-08-21,Business Class," From Toronto to Pisa British Airways used a wet leased Air Belgium plane. Crew on board very friendly and helpful but at times struggled to provide full dinner service speedily. Food was excellent. Business Class cabin comfortable. Weather related delay and blocked arrival gate resulted in short connection time at LHR. To our great surprise British Airways waited for us at the exit of the plane and drove our family (7 people ranging from 3 to 62 years) from Terminal 5 to Terminal 3, escorted us through security and brought us to and even through our departure gate and onto our flight to Pisa. Without this transfer help we would have missed our connection. Flight to Pisa on time, good crew, good on board catering, arrived 15 minutes before the time.",yes,2019,0.02063024,0.12642506,0.85294473,-1
2019-08-21,Economy Class," A very good service on board this flight with British Airways from LHR to VCE. Although the flight was about 30 minutes delayed due to an aircraft change from an Airbus A319 to and Airbus A320, we arrived only slightly behind the scheduled arrival time. The crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean (probably because the plane was relatively new). The seat was not too bad either with quite good leg room. One small issue that I could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board, you had to pay or use Avios (it isn't that bad as it was only to Europe). An overall very good experience on board this flight.",yes,2019,0.0059434595,0.037946377,0.9561101,4
2019-08-15,Economy Class,  Gatwick to Orlando. Excellent customer service. On arriving at Gatwick airport and checking in I learn that my interpretation of the USA esta rules was wrong and that I would have to apply for a new esta valid for the duration of my trip. This took longer than it should have and BA kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found Me in the terminal and got our bags checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft. The aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time. During the flight drinks were served and two food services. Towards the end of the flight I developed a bad nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring. So despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger BA really came through for me. The return journey went without a hitch and BA's check in at Orlando was quick and easy.,yes,2019,0.07489761,0.25806278,0.66703963,1
2019-08-14,Economy Class,  London to Munich. The plane is A320. The seat is more comfortable than other airlines A320. It has a very comfortable headrest and it is made from leather.

2019-08-12,Economy Class," No problems at the airport in Vienna, it was easy to find the British Airways check in desk. The flight was on time. The cabin crew was very kind and the flight was very pleasant. I also ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbread, and it was very delicious. The only problem was at Heathrow, because the gate bridge had a malfunction, so we had to wait for about an hour at the aircraft. But it is not an airliner mistake. After all I enjoyed the flight with British Airways.",yes,2019,0.015405667,0.06582403,0.9187703,-1
2019-08-02,Economy Class,"  London Heathrow to Sofia. We checked in online, so we went straight to baggage drop. It was quick and worked well, our bag was 25 kg, maximum is 23 kg, so we had to take 2 kg out. After that, we went to buy a neck cushion and we went to put our make up in bags, show our passport and then go through to security. My daughter was beeped, but it wasn't a big deal. It was fast, and our flight was departing in 1h 30m. We got some drinks, and then we noticed our gate was announced early. We headed to the gate and boarding began about 20m later. Boarding was fast, and we were sitting in seats 33 DEF. The seats were comfortable, leather and had headrests. A321 so there was no IFE. We had a 1 hour delay from the bad airspace, but eventually took off. Our route was a little different, instead of going over France, Switzerland, etc, we went over Germany, Hungary, etc. The food was good and wasn't too expensive. We didn't buy anything really, just food. While coming into Bulgaria, the views were nice. The landing was pretty good, despite the bump. Eventually we got off 1 hour late, and we went home. The verdict is that British Airways are pretty good, despite the delay.",yes,2019,0.019074015,0.18972848,0.7911975,5
2019-08-01,Economy Class,  Buenos Aires to London Heathrow. My wife and I flew back from Argentina on my birthday and the trip was made memorable by an air hostess (Amelia) who gave great service to everyone with her friendly professional manner. On finding out it was my birthday she came back with a complimentary drink and personal birthday card. The trip itself left on time and arrived in London early. The aircraft was quite old but we found the seats relatively comfortable. The entertainment is below standard especially the size of the screen .,yes,2019,0.009713858,0.085980214,0.904306,0
2019-07-30,Economy Class,"  Seattle to Durban via London. On 24th of July i arrived late just before departure time 1330hrs, the shuttle bus picked me late from my hotel. The British airways ladies who checked me advised me to rush because the plane was about to depart. I rushed through the security thereby leaving my back pack which had all my documents. When i was rushing back to the security i met the 2 lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked me to go up with them to the plane because it was about to leave, i panicked and they assured me that i will get my back pack in Durban. As i sat down in the plane another British airways hostess came and reassured me that i will get all my bags in Durban. On my arrival in Durban i got all my bags including my back pack! I would like to say thank you to the British Airways staff especially the 2 lovely ladies who checked me in. Its a pity i didn't get their names i was panicky. Thank you so much!",yes,2019,0.04865933,0.20756851,0.7437722,3
2019-07-29,Economy Class," Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route. For the price paid, I'd be happy to fly them again.",yes,2019,0.012990095,0.14360164,0.8434083,2
2019-07-24,Premium Economy,"  London to Dubai. Lately I am frequently flying Premium Economy with British Airways. The extra comfort compared to Economy Class is unparalleled. The seat is way more comfortable, attendants are really professional and very friendly. If just could add the leg rest into all the other seats, and not just the first row (as it used to be in the old BA Premium Economy seats), then it would be perfect. That's my only note.",yes,2019,0.010383644,0.08942309,0.90019333,0
2019-07-21,Economy Class,  Tel Aviv to Toronto via London. The plane from London to Toronto was run by Air Belgium The service from checkin until we received our cases here in Israel was excellent. The cabin staff on each airline were helpful and friendly. The food was all acceptable for economy airline food and we had snacks and on 1 flight icecream was served. Soft drinks as well as wine and alcohol was plentiful for the people that asked and water was served all during each flight. The planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy class. Inflight entertainment was good enough there was something to watch on 4 flights. I haven't travelled British Airways for years but I will do again if the price is competitive as were these flights,yes,2019,0.0070623206,0.056044552,0.93689305,0
2019-07-18,Business Class,"  The first part from Brussels to London Heathrow was a fast flight, however on the ground in London the problems started. The gate where the arriving plane was planned to stop was not free what occurred in a waiting time on the ground for 40 minutes. The captain constantly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteous. Continental breakfast in business was OK for this short flight. Flight to Larnaca was full, embarkation was prompt for business pax. The team was very friendly. The service started with a drink and some cookies , the meal was good despite a more substantial appetiser could be expected - a few slices of green salad and one cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiser. It must be said the meal was an improvement since last year. Decent drinks and a good Champagne were available, followed by coffee or tea. It is a longer flight - a second round of drinks an hour before landing was maybe appropriated however it was not a problem to receive additional drinks.",yes,2019,0.01841163,0.1692488,0.81233954,5
2019-07-05,Economy Class,  Return flight to Dublin. Outbound Galleries North fine and good breakfast. Flight was fine. Return flight was delayed by 40 mins gate staff kept us informed.

2019-06-28,Economy Class," London Heathrow to New York. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience, refreshing to see these days. The quality of food and drinks was wonderful. There was plenty of leg room as well. We would definitely fly again with BA, and are planning on making this our only airline if it flies to all of my destinations. On departure my TV did not work they tried twice to reset it for me, however this did not work. That was fine I resolved to reading my book. Just before landing our flight attendant who had be looking after us, asked if it had been rectified, I replied, no but it was ok. She came back with a bottle of Champagne, a pair of Pyjamas and a makeup bag full of goodies, not just for me but for my sister as well!! To say I was overwhelmed was an understatement! All I can say is Thank you British Airways from the bottom of my heart! The trip was for my Birthday and you certainly made it something special!",yes,2019,0.006155,0.022622107,0.97122294,3
2019-06-27,Business Class,"  Gatwick to Bermuda. Boarded very quickly and on time, Seating area smart, appearance much better than the old aircraft that normally turn up. Service very good, food was the best I have had from BA, new crockery added to the good feel and appearance, long overdue. Duvet and bedding much better and what you expect for this high-cost route, the Pillow is fabulous, gone are the small pillows and we now have a luxurious pillow you want to use. 10/10 for this flight and the crew, even though it was full up front, I hope this is a turning point for British Airways.

2019-06-27,Business Class,  London Heathrow to Larnaca. Perfect. The early morning departure meant that Terminal 5 was unusually quiet. The Galleries Lounge offered a wide range of food and drinks in a pleasant environment. The flight took off and landed on time. The cabin crew were incredibly attentive and provided a very professional and pleasant onboard experience. Arrival procedures at Larnaca were incredibly efficient. We completed immigration and picked up our hold baggage within 30 minutes of arriving at the gate. All in all a very enjoyable trip.,yes,2019,0.002072225,0.016923359,0.9810044,0
2019-06-26,Economy Class,"  Heathrow to Kalamata. Heathrow T5 to Kalamata, Greece 8th June and return 1 week later. Used Avios points to upgrade to exit row seats for more legroom. Bad news - took off 1 1/2 hours late from Heathrow (delays to previous incoming flight) but made up about 1/2 hour on the journey out. Also left Kalamata about 1/2 hour late on our return but landed virtually on time. Seats much more comfortable with more padding than, for example, Ryanair or Jet2.com so with the extra legroom, the flights were pretty comfortable. Expensive (or course) M&S offerings for food but tasty enough. Pleasant FA's so all in all decent flights. Haven't used BA for short haul for quite a few years but would use again if the price was right.",yes,2019,0.030897949,0.22971658,0.7393854,-1

My first flight in Economy is the new A321 Neo, The aircraft is set up with the first 15 rows of regular seats and the remaining 17 rows of the new extra slim economy seats. The seat does not recline, is very thin and OK for an hour flight. However 3 hours 45 minutes flight it became pretty uncomfortable after 2 hours.

Check in was easy and swift and the Concorde Room was excellent. The flight itself was wonderful, while I accept it isn’t the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to none. The cabin crew were friendly greeting us by name and showing us personally to our seats. Throughout they ensured we were very well looked after without them being overbearing. New soft product is very good and food definitely much improved. ",yes,2019,0.0050041373,0.02809524,0.9669006,0

Unfortunately I was taken ill on this flight and the service went from good to superb! I’d like to thank the cabin crew and Captain for the care I received during the last two hours of the flight. Advice was sought via radio, I was made comfortable in the galley, at least one crew member with me at all times, given oxygen etc. paramedic boarded the plane and escorted me off when I was then given a thorough medical check, a wheel chair was waiting and we were fast tracked through customs as I was not well enough to walk to the car park.

2019-05-28,Economy Class,  London to Milan. Evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty. Boarding by group number worked effectively and I was able to store my laptop in the overhead. Free newspapers were available in the jet way. Passengers were warmly greeted. I was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently. Usual on board trolley service which I didn't use. Flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in Linate 20 minutes late. Return flight could have been a challenge due to Italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early. The cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer - outstanding. We were taken off the aircraft and bussed into T5 which I think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control. All in all a couple of very good flights.,yes,2019,0.021674052,0.13210101,0.84622496,-1
2019-05-28,Business Class,"  The connecting flight to Johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. Everything went smoothly and service was good. Boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. Much has been said about the BA ying-yang seat configuration. The seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. However the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellent. We had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. The centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. The service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. Preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. There was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. Breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. There could be no complaints in respect of catering. The A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. It is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. The only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in Leeds. The airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seen. There was only one other arrival, but we still waited over 30 minutes for luggage to come through.",yes,2019,0.028927278,0.18155226,0.78952044,-1
2019-05-27,Business Class," London Heathrow to Los Angeles. Very nice experience. I read other reviews slamming BA but that was not the experience we had. From the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic. Crew on the flight was outstanding and very attentive. Food was good, not great, but very good. Seats worked well and comfy (more on that in the seat review). Again, the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home run. In flight entertainment worked well but was not streaming with I like over the monitors. AA does a very good job on this One World route as well but I would take BA over AA if you can but both airlines do a good job on these longer hauls.",yes,2019,0.010945266,0.05738473,0.93167007,0
2019-05-27,Business Class," CPT is definitely getting its act together: BA's Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. The upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in Club World. That's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolution. The new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. The dinner service was according to the new CW 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. On the whole, I think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. Breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff. Apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule. A good flight, overall, but an old style business class experience.",yes,2019,0.008003634,0.09437853,0.89761776,2
2019-05-20,Business Class,"  The cabin crew on flight BA035 London to Chennai were very efficient and did their best to take care of their clients. I did tell them I would write a review and here it is. Keep up the good service and, thanks!",yes,2019,0.004016347,0.03541662,0.96056706,-1
2019-05-19,Economy Class,"  Gatwick to Malaga. Check in was fairly quick. The check in area at Gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep. The whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets. If you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring. The lounge at Gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy, there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit. The food and drink offering was very good. Tasty and varied. On board I was lucky to be able to book the exit row, which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion. Food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me. The food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of sandwiches or snacks.. drinks selection is better. What was very nice was, near the end of the flight I was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member. I wouldn’t expect this, and I’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up, but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers. Still no WiFi or WiFi based in flight entertainment offered. Priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant. My bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags. Overall a decent flight, and very good value as I paid using avios. Being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus.",yes,2019,0.06941268,0.18969135,0.740896,1
2019-05-18,First Class,"  London to Cape Town in First and our first taste of the new 'soft' product. Still, unfortunately, a 30 year-old 747 that hadn't had its refurbishment and was showing its age. A wardrobe door that's falling off its hinges, a non-touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won't stay shut don't pass muster in First and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on-board service. The young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about. Care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food. For once, nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent. Bedding is also improved, with a good quality duvet and large pillow. The IFE remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film. The goodies bag is much better and worth taking home. Overall, a pretty good flight, but it remains to be seen what BA will do with its long-in-the-tooth First Class when their new Club Suites are launched.",yes,2019,0.047749337,0.23595858,0.7162921,4
2019-05-17,Economy Class,"  This review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on BA 174 from JFK New York to Heathrow on Tue 14th May. I was travelling back from New York following a few days break with 11 girlfriends. Check in and boarding was all on schedule,however it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue; this resulted in over an hour's delay leaving NY. Despite this annoying delay, the cabin crew more than made up for this. They were friendly, polite and couldn't do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable, they were all exceptional, even those that were not serving in the section I was in. I do hope that this information is passed on.",yes,2019,0.059124034,0.22394729,0.7169287,3
2019-05-08,Economy Class," Vancouver to London. An excellent flight on BA. I travel this route several times a year and generally BA are much better than AC, Especially on this flight, BA were way ahead of the competition.

2019-05-07,First Class," Washington to London. Having travelled out to Washington from Heathrow on 23/04/19 First Class I wasn't overly impressed. Although the Concorde Room was relaxing and comfortable, the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive. The cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach. My return journey couldn't have been more different. The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. Nothing short of amazing. I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about. Demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach. A fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist. Having had mixed levels of service with BA and always flying Virgin I think BA need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training.",yes,2019,0.0063283388,0.046034444,0.94763726,3
2019-05-07,Economy Class," Rome Fiumicino to London City. A BA Cityflyer service. No wait to check in. Aircraft was not full. We pushed back early and arrived early.

Whenever the airhostesses passed through the aisle (I was on a seat next to the aisle) we would exchange some friendly comments which almost always lead to muffled laughs!  One air hostess admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter! ,yes,2019,0.0020650425,0.01964305,0.978292,0
2019-04-22,Economy Class,  Dublin to London Heathrow. British Airways offered a very good overall service on this flight. I booked online and found that process very easy. The caveat was not being able to select the seat I wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee. The check-in lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself. The flight departed on-time and the captain made frequent announcements. Within the previous two weeks I had flown with BA twice within Europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff. The flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort. One curiosity was the staff handing out UK landing cards The flight was punctual and reliable.,yes,2019,0.0036311087,0.042321745,0.9540471,0

2019-04-14,Economy Class,"  London Heathrow to Houston. Despite sitting at the back of the plane we were really well looked after. Without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional. They really seemed to be enjoying their work. Lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight. Commendably, even in these days of austerity, my pre lunch gin was served with Fever Tree tonic. Well done BA. Frequent drinks runs were made. Despite its age the Jumbo was well turned out internally. The only downside was because of Air Traffic issues at Heathrow the flight arrived late. This meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight. This was mainly down to tardy Immigration procedures, the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight. All very stressful.",yes,2019,0.08219216,0.22432752,0.6934804,5
2019-04-13,Economy Class,  The booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can book. The cost of including a bag added considerably to the cheapest fare. Check-in was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in. Departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well. My gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty.  Some of the to buy M&S food items were not available and the lavatory I used was dirty. The staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop-down route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy. Hardworking crew.,yes,2019,0.050802983,0.15681767,0.7923794,4

2019-04-01,Economy Class,"  London to Seville. Following on from mistakenly booking a return flight with BA despite having a previous confirmed booking with a competitor, I quickly called up BA to resolve the issue. They understood the problem and gave me a full refund. The agent was exceptionally helpful on the phone and provided me a quick answer and solution to the problem. I don’t believe most airlines would have accepted my reasoning, however it’s great to see BA treat their customers with care.",yes,2019,0.03543266,0.15925081,0.80531645,-1
2019-04-01,Business Class,"  Doha to Paris via London. This is the first time using BA since October 2002, nothing has changed,  the same reversible business class seats with very little storage space still comfortable but the business has caught up with BA and left them behind, with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choice. It cannot compare with other business leaders like Cathay and Qatar Airways but on this route BA charges the same price as Qatar Airways but delivers a much poorer product, though the service was OK not as personal but alright. Where they are better is with their check in luggage policy of 2 bags 32 kgs each they are superior and generous. I will still use them but look forward to them rolling in the new business class.",yes,2019,0.10138388,0.29360235,0.6050138,-1
2019-03-29,Business Class,"  Madrid to London BA0457 on the 18/03. Couldn't have been a better service. Long time since I flew Club Europe but it was an amazing experience. The welcome aboard was excellent and so was the service and food. Stephen, one of the flight attendants was so attentive and happy to help that he probably made it the best short haul flight experience I have had in a long time.

2019-03-23,Economy Class,"  London to Vancouver. Check in agent very helpful in searching out seat options. Very smooth process. The disappointment was the receptionist at the Galleries Lounge at T3 who was rude and unhelpful. All was redeemed once on board. The crew were excellent throughout the flight in the best British Airways tradition - friendly, helpful and attentive. Food not great but on a par with economy in other airlines. Wines better than many airlines. The aircraft was clean and reasonably well maintained for an older 747-400. IFE selection good.",yes,2019,0.034952,0.14096156,0.8240864,0
2019-03-14,Business Class,"  Los Angeles to London. A very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the 787. BA have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight . If you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour. Only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is one too many seats across, as it leaves two very narrow gangways; if you have an aisle seat in the ""turn right"" section in Business Class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally(?) by Economy section passengers with their carry-ons when boarding. Food and drinks were excellent, with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers. Entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone. Thanks also to two people most of us forget - the flight crew who got us safely to Heathrow 15 minutes early and put the plane down so gently we hardly noticed we had arrived! Well done BA for providing such a good product and service.",yes,2019,0.013894726,0.060316477,0.92578876,-1
2019-03-13,Economy Class,"  Rome to London. One of the best European airlines to travel with for short haul flights. The online website is very clear and easy to use. Check-in procedure was smooth. The gate was very close to the shopping area. Boarding the flight was very well organised and quick and through the airbridge. The only negative aspect is that you will need to pay for a drink, as they don’t serve anything free on all European routes.",yes,2019,0.04579436,0.15575069,0.798455,-1
2019-03-09,Economy Class," London Heathrow to Madrid. I travel from LHR regularly. British Airways have proved to be reliable and their service is of good quality. As a frequent traveler, I've been able to use the priority boarding and also managed to get exit row seats. This airline is very good with providing tangible benefits to silver members. The lounge at Heathrow Terminal 5 is also very good and provides a good selection of food and refreshments. The bar is very well stocked and also a good selection of soft drinks available. I'm very happy with the airline service and would definitely recommend British Airways. Keep it up guys.",yes,2019,0.0013477275,0.010248953,0.9884034,0
2019-03-08,Economy Class,"  It's been many years since I flew long haul British Airways and I was pleasantly surprised by recent flights. BA staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed. From the time of arriving at London Heathrow T5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful. Similarly on the flight, the attendants couldn't do enough for me. When I requested tomato juice with Worcester sauce, the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it. On the way back I asked for a tonic water and, again, they offered to go and get it. The seating of these newer planes allows me knee room, even though I'm 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too. The entertainment system, though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of Cathay Pacific, nevertheless had a good range of movies and TV to watch. Both flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at Heathrow both ways, and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on. Food quality was reasonable, again not up to the standard of Cathay Pacific, rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which I thought was a bit mean. Overall a very pleasant flight, thanks BA. Is this because competition is hotting up and BA now have to try harder?",yes,2019,0.029064829,0.13738309,0.83355206,5
2019-03-03,Economy Class,"  Flew out of Heathrow on 22nd Feb to New York, 20 mins into our flight and we noticed our Tv's weren't working (4 travellers) but I have to say the cabin crew managed to reset them and they we were working within the hour.

2019-02-20,Premium Economy,"  London to Seoul. I normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of Club was prohibitive and so I thought I would give World Traveller Plus a go. The cabin is stylish and intimate and I was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were. The entertainment system was working well (although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying). I was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming. My only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available. A similar thing happened with breakfast, three options, the third being the most appetizing, and no, it hadn't been loaded, so this is an area BA might want to look into. All in all the service was good and worth the price. For ground service BA, please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work.",yes,2019,0.11020175,0.27646235,0.6133359,-1
2019-02-19,Premium Economy,"  London Heathrow to New York JFK. Bag drop did not go well. Lounge (galleries north ) was good and not crowded. Boarding was fine, small delay, well organised. Pre take off drink was better than the one i got in club world 2 weeks previous. Main meal good, pre flight snack was average but my son really liked it. On time arrival, a good flight. Cabin crew included some of the older staff who are not mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mile. I thought this was a good flight.",yes,2019,0.022303069,0.12145423,0.8562427,-1
2019-02-18,Business Class,"  Gatwick to St Lucia. Flew BA new revamped business class today and a huge improvement on the old set up. Well lit cabin, improved seating comfort, better and operational entertainment system (always hit or miss before) and decent food. Cabin crew worked hard and were pleasant.

2019-02-11,Business Class,"  Tokyo to London. I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787. We had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at Narita. We boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. The food and wines were really good. I had a beautifully-presented Japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. There was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screen. On the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. This was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. The seat was comfortable and reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. The cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. The context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to Tokyo. We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew. We both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement, but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight.",yes,2019,0.08468507,0.2220522,0.69326276,-1
2019-02-11,First Class,  London to Tokyo Haneda. My wife and I treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to Japan with the help of my Avios and a BA Amex companion voucher. We were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated check-in area at Heathrow was great. We boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint. We had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. The cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted. The food and alcoholic drinks were great. I went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding. I was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the IFE. My wife and I both said afterwards that it didn't feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably. My only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep.,yes,2019,0.011430252,0.05107989,0.93748987,-1

Upon arrival I was greeted my a young gentlemen who was very helpful and respectful. He calmed me down and reassured me that everything was going to be okay ,as I was very very stressed thinking I was going to miss my flight.

2019-01-31,Economy Class,"  I've always favoured British Airways and will always try and choose to fly with them, which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travel. I have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early check-in and on-flight catering, for economy. However BA have stripped both the above perks. I now struggle to see the value, and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of Easyjet, yet you pay almost double. Then today I flew back from Denmark with SAS, and it was amazing and made BA look cheap. Not only do you get a good meal on board, you get free drink, can charge your electronics and get wifi (for only 2.9 Euros!). Outstanding.",no,2019,0.007157948,0.04697146,0.94587064,-1
2019-01-30,Business Class," 
The 2-3-2 seating in the front section of Club World on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than 2-4-2, but it's showing its age in contrast to other carriers. A full cabin also means queues for the two loos, although they're a lot more spacious than in First. The drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped Club World food is definitely an improvement. The fish option for the main course was some of the best food I've had in the air. The White Company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats. Cabin crew were generally good and the CSM was particularly visible during the flight. Breakfast was improved with the option to pre-select items. Arrival was ahead of schedule.",yes,2019,0.0052203513,0.058852885,0.9359268,2

Lounge was ok, food a little better and staff seemed more attentive. We were able to use the spa which was nice. Showers were fine with no queues. Flight left on time. My first experience of the new Club World catering which seemed to go well Slept for 5 hours, lie flat on the newer aircraft is better than the older 777’s which (as my son says) have a gap between stool and seat sometimes. Crew on this sector were good and the FA serving our area was experienced and it showed. The CSD seemed to go through the motions only. Arrival fine and baggage was first on belt.

2019-01-28,Business Class,"  BA836 on 19 Jan. Excellent short flight from Heathrow to Dublin in Club Europe. Cabin Crew were warm and efficient and the overall service excellent. The Club Europe catering was excellent, I had pre-ordered a gluten-free meal which was the same as one of the standard passenger meals but with gluten-free bread. The main course was beef ratatouille with a Do&Co dessert pot. This was the best inflight meal I've had on a short haul flight. On arrival in Dublin the ground service from Swissport was poor, it took some time for steps to meet the aircraft and then even longer (25 minutes) for ground staff to open the door to allow arriving passengers into the terminal.",yes,2019,0.015845785,0.08572238,0.89843184,0
2019-01-24,Economy Class," Copenhagen to Amsterdam via London Heathrow with British Airways. There was problems at check in and a lot of people had to run to make the flight. But the attitude and welcoming hospitality of the crew made me forget that and I enjoyed the flight. The seats were nice and comfortable and the aircraft fresh. During the second flight from LHR to AMS, the expectations from the first flight were fulfilled and we had a captain that knew most of the passengers were frequent fliers and made jokes only frequent fliers would understand. Like how the taxi from Polderban is almost as long as the flight itself.",yes,2019,0.038718216,0.17317821,0.7881035,-1
2019-01-21,Premium Economy," I used avios point to upgrade from economy to premium economy. They get a wider seat and a few more inches leg room. Boarding was straight forward and the premium cabin had plenty of overhead locker space, water and juice was served before takeoff but no champagne. The staff were well turned out but rushed, as the premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew. A hot meal was served an hour after take off, which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables, chocolate mousse and biscuits & cheese. Quality red and white wine was served. The inflight movie selection was OK. A light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee & tea. Getting off the planes was slowed by immigration staff coming onto the plane to inspect all passports. Not my best flight.",yes,2019,0.06869729,0.32407165,0.6072311,4
2019-01-21,Premium Economy," Boarding was fairly quick, the well turned out staff quickly got people on board and bags stored. I was lucky that no one was sitting next me, so I had some more room. The pre take off drink was water or orange juice.  Within an hour of take off a hot meal of beef - salad was served with a good dessert. Wine selection was very American with jug wines. The movie selection was OK. The PE seats are more comfortable than economy, the extra 4 inches of width make a huge difference. The 2nd meal on this flight was a snack of crisps and cookies.

2019-01-12,Economy Class,"  When the passenger in front reclines his/her seat, it makes it very difficult to get in and out of one's seat. As the arm rests do not go all the way up, the middle/window seat passengers have to climb over. There is little leg room and no leg rest. The Boeing 777 IFE screen is smaller than the ones on the British Airway's 747-400s and could do with an upgrade. The saving grace on this flight was the excellent service from a dedicated and very professional flight crew.",yes,2019,0.060969338,0.27520815,0.6638225,-1

The seat back was almost in my lap making it impossible to read British Airways' magazine or even use my iPad. We ordered special meals (Halal and low sodium). The Muslim meal (chicken tikka masala with naan) was restaurant quality. Flavorful and not spicy hot. The gulab jamun dessert was also restaurant quality and just like mom's. The low sodium meal - herb roasted chicken, tomato rice, petite broccoli, diced red pepper and carrots was delicious. Dessert consisted of fresh blueberries and blackberries. The IFE was very good.

2019-01-09,Economy Class,"  London to Johannesburg. So impressed by the lady that checked us in. Something went wrong with my booking, I was supposed to fly at 18:10 (with my boyfriend) back home to South Africa after our visit in UK, but somehow my ticket was booked at 21:10. We didn’t even notice that until she had brought it up at the check-in. I was so shocked by the fact that I would be traveling all by myself (It’s my first trip overseas). She was so willing to help and she fixed it within a matter of 1 minute. We obviously thought that we would not be able to sit next to each other. With grateful hearts we were checking in our bags. When she gave us our boarding passes she mentioned that we have the best seats on the aircraft! How awesome is that!

2018-12-19,First Class,"  Moscow to London. Fantastic first class service. The Moscow lounge was surprisingly good, with excellent Runway views. Quick boarding, and I was escorted to my seat by the crew. The new First seats on the 787-9 fleet are a real upgrade from the older product. There's plenty of space, a cupboard and several little storage bins in addition to the overhead bin space. The 23 inch flatscreen IFE screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphones. The dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic, the best airline meal I've had. Drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival. The crew were very attentive and friendly with it.

We left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to JFK. On the JFK flight the service was fantastic. The meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flight. We left and arrived on time. The seat and legroom was fine. My mothers IFE didn't work and she was moved seat, which she appreciated.

2018-12-17,First Class,"  Johannesburg to London. In contrast to our excellent outbound experience, inbound lacked the wow factor. The cabin was full and dominated by a few passengers who seemed to want to demonstrate their importance. Cabin crew were adequate rather than outstanding. The dinner service was unremarkable, too, and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flights. My IFE touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous month. Sleep quality was reasonable, although the high cabin temperature made the duvet redundant. Breakfast was pretty good. Arrival was on time and we were relieved to find that our bags had made their way from a domestic Comair flight.",no,2018,0.061133545,0.20912677,0.72973967,0

However, during my trip from London to Mexico City on 2 Dec 2018, it is quite interesting with the cabin crew facilitating me, especially associated with Muslim needs on food. They are polite and talk to me with big smiles. So, when I returned back to Malaysia and transit in London from Mexico City on 5 Dec 2018, I wished I will be able to meet them again.

The crew seemed relaxed and happy and worked well as a team. BA have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was one of the best I’ve ever had on a long haul flight. The aircraft was old and dated and the IFE was a throwback to the 90’s with unresponsive touch screen and hard to watch quality as we all so used to HD quality these days.

2018-11-27,First Class,"  London to Johannesburg. Turning right to the first wing at T5 was a new experience for us. It was all pretty slick, although the guy at check-in wasn't exactly Mr Convivial. The Concorde Room was impressive, too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design, overlooking the main concourse. Boarding involved lining up according to group. This smacked a bit of low-cost airlines, but I guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane. The first cabin on the A380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space. The dividers seemed higher, too, giving better privacy. The fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. Cabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professional. Food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly. The wines on offer were a good selection, including the fabulous LPGS, and we enjoyed some wine tasting. Sleep quality was considerably better than Club World, although the cabin temperature was a little high. Overall, an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel.",yes,2018,0.0038377126,0.04220045,0.95396185,-1

On the aircraft, there was sufficient seat legroom for my seat 7F.  A funny safety video played and the flight was smooth. No food was served, except some M&S, BBC news was playing on the screens, with no sound and Russian captions, quite confusing.

My long haul flight was also good, aircraft was 20yrs old but clean, cabin crew were very nice, friendly and efficient, my pre ordered meal was absolutely fantastic, the only complaint I can have is the in flight entertainment needs to be improved, ie, try showing some classic British comedy programmes instead of the unfunny modern stuff, and also include some good classic rock music that people have actually heard of, apart from that, absolutely great, well recommended.",yes,2018,0.007925247,0.027990311,0.9640845,0
2018-10-25,Economy Class,"  While it is still fresh in my mind, I’d like to commend the hard working crew of my BA flight from St.Petersburg to London Heathrow on 23rd October 2018. The check-in staff were very professional and helpful and assisted me with a query. Boarding was operated remarkably efficiently and in a precise and orderly manner. The cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor too. The cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. The captain was informative. My only gripe was the lack of a route map on this flight and the M&S buy on board option was a bit tedious. Disembarkation was equally well managed and passengers were fare welled in a courteous and sincere way. This flight has restored my faith in BA.

Addressed by name - adequate breakfast of bacon roll, fruit and yoghurt. Concorde Room not crowded and no wait for showers. LHR-PHL on aged 747 but still my favorite - cabin/washrooms in very good shape though. I have no problem with the BA F layout unlike so many posters here. Excellent flight - experienced crew and though full cabin, all very smooth and professional. Beautifully prepared and presented lamb shank, good wines as always - nice to see a good British bubbly included. Only downside was deplaning in PHL where F passengers had to fight their way off through the J scrum - could have been controlled by crew, but was not.",yes,2018,0.015861263,0.08211579,0.90202296,-1
2018-10-17,Business Class,"  Singapore to London Heathrow. It's my first time traveling on British Airways. The seat arrangement in its long-haul business class is very uncommon that half of the seats are facing backward. So you are face-to-face with the one sitting opposite you (at least during taking off and landing when the divider is lowered down). There are 8 Club World seats per row for 777-300ER, which is relatively narrower if comparing with other carriers serving this route. The cabin service was as good as expected. However, I saw only chocolate bars and sweets for the minibar during night. There could be some other choices.",yes,2018,0.0142641235,0.20253846,0.7831974,0

2018-09-25,Business Class," London - Pisa (Return). I fly this route often as we have a house in Tuscany. This, in all reasonableness was the best so far - but only just. Outbound we went through the ""First"" wing check in at T5. (We are Gold card members). The breakfast we had in the lounge was just about OK. The South lounge was rammed. We took off on time and I declined a cooked breakfast. The lady next to me had a full English and it did look rather nice. The Captain popped out for the loo, and I caught his eye and enjoyed a pleasant ten minutes or so chat about aviation. A very nice bloke, who landed the plane superbly. Coming home, we were delayed by 45 minutes due to storm Ali. We had a very good lunch with the new Club Europe menu which came into effect two days earlier. A nice prawn cocktail and a very nice coronation Chicken. Downed a couple of G&Ts. FAs on both flights were great. There has been a massive improvement here on the catering side. The seating is still hopeless. Three seats between two and zero legroom. BA really should look at the competition in the Far East who offer excellent regionalized business class. The product is only worth it in a Sale or Avious points. The every day fare price is ludicrous.",no,2018,0.022258742,0.10772694,0.87001425,2

BA34 KUL-LHR 6 Sept, return BA11 LHR-SIN-KUL on 16 Sept. All flights in World Traveller Plus with the exception of SIN-KUL on MH economy. On the KUL-LHR leg, the aircraft was clean and spacious in the PY cabin. The seats were the biggest let down. Whilst there was adequate legroom, they were hard and uncomfortable, especially when reclined with virtually no lumbar support. The headrest did not move at all. The seats taper at the waist which is odd and given that they are quite wide, there is very little storage apart from the usual pocket which I think is a missed opportunity by BA to maximise utilisation of space. The food was okay, you get two meals, the first being quite substantial but the second was a joke. IFE was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging. The return flight was on an A380. Excellent boarding procedure as it was a full flight. Again, seats were the same but the A380 has that wonderful storage space on the upper cabin. Staff were less conspicuous this time around. Overall, I would recommend them but attention needs to be paid to their seats.",yes,2018,0.07153326,0.30818123,0.6202856,4
2018-09-16,Premium Economy,"  British Airways is my favorite airline. Boeing 777 was 21 years old but clean. The staff was professional. Food was above expectation.

2018-09-15,Economy Class,"  Rome to Newark via London. The first sector was on a A319. Flight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on time. Boarding at FCO was initially by groups and then a free for all after groups 1 and 2. Flight attendants friendly and welcoming. Seat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tight. There was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased - even water. No entertainment either. Was prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than what appeared to be on the M&S menu. Connection at T5 was smooth as anything given our arrival mid afternoon. Boarding for the flight to Newark was organised and painless. I was dreading this 787 flight a little based on my previous experience with another airline where it felt cramped. Happy to say, the seat comfort was pretty good, legroom was manageable. I was however surprised that for a 2 year old aircraft (i checked), it was pretty dirty. There was grime around the USB port (which didn't work), tv screen and along the floor by the wall. The cushion on the seatback in front appeared to be busting out the sides as well. I found the touchscreen IFE to be outdated and slightly slow in response. The selection was not as extensive but I did find some excellent British content that I had not seen before. The real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience shone through in just how consistently friendly, professional and warm they were with their service. They were generous with drinks and very efficient and quick. The main meal was decent though the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointing. All in all, a surprisingly good flight on the transatlantic leg in comparison to the sub par european sector.",yes,2018,0.084377274,0.2647376,0.6508851,-1
2018-09-12,First Class,"  London Heathrow to Dubai. This was the first time I had flown in first class  on BA. I had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed. BA's first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isn't the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates. We were on a 777 which is probably one of the oldest in the BA fleet. The cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious. The sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy. It is nice they offer a male and female kit, my wife was delighted with the contents. The Champagne that BA offer in first is superb. I enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne I have tasted. Choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the Johnnie Walker Blue Label if you are a whiskey drinker. Food was very tasty and well presented. I had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached baby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then Lamb Machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille. We were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing. I cant really fault any of it. It was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too. IFE was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing,. I believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787. I do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice. The thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew. From the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous. Attentive with out being over-bearing. Witty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need. They were superb. Wifi was available but the page to connect didn't load up when i tried it. I dint really pursue it to be honest as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer. This was a great flight and i would wholly recommend that you try out first. Whether i would choose it over Club World would be on flight by flight basis. You have to do it once though!",yes,2018,0.0071860077,0.052406963,0.940407,-1
2018-09-10,Business Class," Flew Madrid to London Heathrow. The 767 is ancient and BA have clearly given up on hiding that fact, I guess they will be phasing these old but great planes out of service soon. I love flying in 767s, the configurations are generally very comfortable but to be honest the plane was really dated and BA should definitely improve this. Aside from this the flight was really very good indeed. BA Business class has in my experience always been consistent, consistently good. BA cabin crew in Business class are a real asset. This was one of BA's more traditional crews and they create a very agreeable atmosphere. The flight was very busy but the staff were very efficient and the loading on the flight did not prejudice the overall experience. Food was very tasty indeed and there was an excellent selection of drinks. I'll be sad to see the 767s go but the time has come.",yes,2018,0.008659459,0.045748845,0.94559175,-1

Plane was looking it's age and a bit run down around the edges. Premium economy offering in cabin and seat comfort far superior on A380. What made this journey very good was the young lady looking after the premium economy cabin. Polite, efficient, welcoming and nothing was any bother for her. Service with a smile from start to finish . People in here quick to criticise poor service so big shout out to this crew member for doing a great job. Also meals and drink selection very good.

Forward Business Class cabin on 787 is fairly private. Service on both flights was flawless, very attentive to the three small children while also allowing the adults to enjoy the meals. Food presentation especially on the intercontinental leg was really nice and the food on both flights was simply fantastic. Outstanding crew on BA 603 and BA 99 - on our outgoing flights from Toronto on August 16 similar great service. BA gets often negative reviews but myself travelling regularly with them have never had a bad experience. Their seating arrangement in Club World is perfect when travelling with family.

2018-08-21,First Class,"  London Heathrow to Singapore. Had a great experience in the Concorde Room, and Galleries First lounges in Heathrow T5. I was warmly greeted by a member of the crew, who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and have a look around, all because I expressed a slight interest, and for that I am thankful. The flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpit. The seat was very well presented, there was a small amenity kit, as well as a pair of pyjamas. The seat was clean with pillows, as well as ample storage space. You get a closet to hang clothes, a little compartment next to the seat, as well as the overhead bin, so I never ran out of room. The pre-departure beverage was a choice of water, orange juice, or champagne and hot towels were handed out. The flight left slightly behind schedule, but at Heathrow, this is something you expect. Very soon after take-off, the crew began serving dinner. I had already booked my meal in advance, but the choice of starters, mains and deserts, as well as the beverage menu, was very good. The meal I had was exceptionally tasty and I would have it again! Once dinner service had finished, the crew turned down the bed for me, whilst I went and changed into the comfortable pyjamas that were provided. The bed was very comfortable and at just over 6 feet tall, I did not have any issues fitting into the bed and stretching out. There were plenty of blankets and pillows available and I slept very well. When I awoke, I was offered coffee and a short while later, breakfast. The breakfast choices were continental, or cooked. I opted for the cooked option and I was not disappointed, as it was very tasty, and there was a lot of it. The inflight entertainment was good, and there was a large range of films, TV programmes/series, audio books, and kids programmes to choose from. The system was responsive and was good quality, although I did not watch any films, so I cannot speak of the sound quality. The crew served with a smile and even when I asked for a Latte, which the machine didn’t do, the crew went out of their way to make one for me which was very nice.

2018-08-14,Economy Class,  London to Dublin. This was an early morning departure from Heathrow on a full flight. BA managed everything in a very professional manner. The bag-drop was efficient and the boarding process was conducted according to the rules. The cabin crew were immaculate in appearance and conducted the safety demonstration along with a video. During this short and very busy flight the crew were able to sell drinks and snacks and left a superb impression. I had a not so good experience with this airline earlier in the year and am glad to see that this time they were superb.,yes,2018,0.009809936,0.05766908,0.932521,0

2018-08-09,Business Class,"  Gatwick to Paphos in Club Europe. We travelled on the first Saturday of the school holidays and whilst Gatwick was busy the check in for business class was not to bad. We expected the lounge to be busy but there was plenty of free seats. The flight boarded slightly late but we were not long in the take off queue. We are used the BA's Club Europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the flight was reasonably comfortable. Service from the cabin crew was good. It is nice that BA have gone away from the miniature bottles of wine in Club Europe and now serve by the glass. The meal service was quite good, we both chose the chicken curry for the main course, which was tasty and not dried out. Flight arrived 5 minutes ahead of schedule. Very happy with the service.",yes,2018,0.0031273137,0.021132445,0.97574025,1
2018-07-31,Premium Economy,"  London to Santiago de Chile. I was flying premium economy with BA and surprised that I got a row (2 seats on the left side) for my own. The seat was spacious and even with an occupied neighbour seat, I would have had enough space to feel very comfortable. However, Lufthansa on the A380 (also Y+) gives a bit more personal space (at least it seems to me). The seat recline was good as well as the ife system (big screen, wide choice of programs of which I chose to listen to some BBC concerts). The crew didn't impress me but was very friendly and helpful. The food was extraordinarily good (the chicken I had was very delicious) with sufficient food (cheese, salad, dessert). The frittata on breakfast wasn't good, however. I didn't like that they sealed the drinks 40 minutes before the arrival (a bit early).  I had a good experience with BA and would definitely fly again as all the things (seat, ground, service, staff) were like expected (the dinner was way above average). Premium economy is a good value for money, especially on a 15 hrs flight.",yes,2018,0.018063245,0.09573269,0.88620406,4
2018-07-30,Economy Class," Flew London Gatwick to Tirana Rinas. Bag drop at Gatwick was basically seamless, and BA was offering to check in your hand baggage for free. The flight was at 8:10 and the gate was supposed to be shown at 7:24 am, which was oddly specific, but as we got closer to that time, that just got more and more delayed. Until we finally got our gate info at around 7:45. For which boarding had already started. Boarding was pretty much seamless. The cabin crew greeted all the passengers which was nice. The legroom was alright, perfectly fine for a 2 and and a half hour flight. Good recline aswell. I don’t understand why British Airways opted for buy on board, their free food offering before was perfectly fine. Although the food offering was just a few sandwiches which were quite expensive. And there was no real hot food options, just a few of their sandwiches could be served hot. Flights were on time. Flights cost around £320 return per person, which was quite pricey considering the cheapest option was around half the price. So overall, it’s a good option, but if you can find something cheaper, then go for it.",yes,2018,0.06590205,0.28268513,0.65141284,1
2018-07-29,Economy Class,"  London Heathrow to Murcia and back. A few problems at Heathrow with the wrong gate being shown (BA ground staff didn't seem to care this was an issue) but the flights were excellent, comfortable and on time. I really don't mind paying for the food and drink inflight, especially as you can pay using Avios. Murcia airport also a joy. Small, efficient and friendly. I will only fly BA on short haul in Europe. Very impressed.",yes,2018,0.025416609,0.075800814,0.89878255,0
2018-07-23,Premium Economy,"  I thought it time BA deserved some compliments given so many negative comments that are common these days. I was fortunate to travel Hong Kong to London return in Premium Economy recently. Being able to check-in at the downtown Hong Kong Airport Express station is a real bonus as is using the good Qantas Lounge at Hong Kong. I found the on-board service and operations a lot improved over the last time I flew long-haul with BA.. The new Group Boarding sequence system mostly seems to work, although a few of the signs are hidden or bent in the wrong direction so some people had no idea what was going on - but which helped me keep busy assisting people while waiting at the gates. Food and wine on-board was quite good and overall service excellent, including recognising my One World Status. BA has the best in-flight magazine with articles actually worth reading and also has some very clever in-flight programs. I also particularly welcomed the excellent service from 'Goswami' who found me a window seat for LHR-HKG when returning and when using the First Lounge at Heathrow. All-in -all made for an enjoyable experience, a rarity these days.",yes,2018,0.0052220193,0.040270276,0.9545077,6
2018-07-22,Business Class,"  Gatwick to Faro. Club check in at Gatwick is very quick and easy, and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club lounge. The lounge itself is really nice, spacious enough to have plenty of seating available, and different types of seating, but it also feels very cosy and welcoming. The lounge was clean and tidy and there were pretty good food options available.. including some lovely scones with clotted cream and jam. As always the drinks offering in BA lounges was great. The new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and BA staff are finally enforcing the priority system.. long may it continue! On board was the usual club Europe offering.. which while not exactly luxury is standard for Europe now and for a 3 hour flight is fine. BA don’t ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete, there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind.. it’s a quick and simple gesture that should be done on any decent carrier. I would also like to see menus handed out before take off, which could be done at the same time as a welcome. The food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food was typically over cooked and with sloppy presentation. Overall a decent enough flight and for a reasonable price, but a few small touches would make it feel much better.",yes,2018,0.027131801,0.1202047,0.8526636,1
2018-07-19,Business Class," Gatwick to Malaga. When booking the tickets, I realised that by choosing certain flights in Club the fare was cheaper than economy once I had added suitcases and pay for food onboard, I hadn´t flown BA Club in Europe for a while and was looking forward to it. I was nicely impressed. My outbound flight was a wet-lease by Titan but this was the full BA service. The crew were very good as they were friendly and polite without being sugary sweet. I was very impressed by the quality and quantity of the food together with the selection of drinks. The only fault is that on both legs my suitcase did not come out as priority despite being tagged correctly.",yes,2018,0.013275793,0.062513195,0.924211,1
2018-07-15,Economy Class,  Munich to London Heathrow with British Airways. I booked my flight online about 3 months ahead of my planned travel date and thought I would give this airline another try after a bad experience earlier in the year. I give full marks to BA on this occasion in most areas of service. I arrived at the airport rather stressed as my mobile phone had been stolen in a Salzburg coffee shop. The check-in agent was very professional and reassuring towards me and entered into banter very willingly. He was professional and pleasant and very efficient too. The flight was on an A320 and boarding was managed well and the staff well presented too. The cabin crew were welcoming and orderly. Although there was a delay it was managed well and the cabin crew explained matters as the flight progressed. I bought an overpriced tea and felt very comfortable. Arrival was at a remote stand and then a bus. Overall a very good experience with BA.,yes,2018,0.012972201,0.07280706,0.91422075,3

2018-06-29,Premium Economy,"  Mumbai to Edinburgh via London. I'm quite surprised to read the varied reviews as I have always had a great experience with BA in terms of in-flight service and airport handling. After sales service can be a different experience! This flight I arrived a little late at the airport due to transport issues, hot and sweaty and the check-in girl was such a blessing. She calmed me down, reassured me and helped me get through security swiftly. I was able to secure a very cheap last-minute upgrade to Premium Economy and I am so glad I did. The service was wonderful, we were looked after very well, lots of water offered throughout the flight. I thought the seat was tremendously spacious and comfortable, even for the regular upgrade price, 2 rather than 3 seats to the side and 3 rather than 4 in the centre, gives you a lot more space. The food was ok, I've had worse, I've had better. But I was comfortable, a good temperature and had a great choice of films. My connecting plane was late leaving Heathrow to Edinburgh due to bad weather, but it was handled very nicely. All in all I'm glad I flew BA for this trip.",yes,2018,0.008504676,0.039049402,0.95244586,-1
2018-06-25,Business Class,"  British Airways gets plenty of well deserved kickings but this return flight to Gibraltar was faultless.

Gibraltar lounge for the dozen or so club passengers is relatively huge.",yes,2018,0.014696791,0.09870483,0.88659835,1
2018-06-22,Business Class," We can not fault the new 'Club World' food and service, on the 747 outbound and 777 inbound it was great! The food was first class, the presentation very attractive, the quality very high - haven't had such tender beef on any airline before (or in a restaurant for that matter lately!) and the new style crockery/glass wear stylishly upmarket. It's worlds away from what it used to be, both crews were attentive, friendly and cheerful. Really liked the way the food came out on a trolley and you could pick and choose what you liked and mix and match if you wanted to. You now get a light day blanket, a padded blanket for night and a mattress protector type thing to put on the base of your seat, much better than the thin always static blanket you used to get. The pillow is larger and tons better than before. Can't believe how fast the time flew and how well we felt on landing both in Seattle and once home again. We do mainly Club Europe flights, shame as if this level of service and food is maintained the new Club World will be a great success.",yes,2018,0.0069553372,0.03655886,0.9564858,2
2018-06-08,Economy Class,"  First time flying with British Airways in economy on a Transatlantic flight from London to Chicago. I was impressed by the hard work of the professional and friendly Flight Attendants. They walked up and down the plane helping people with various issues and offering good tasty meals, snacks and drinks of all kinds. I will definitely fly British overseas again given a chance. The economy seats on this old but well kept Boeing 747-400 were very comfortable and I am a 5'9"" x 240lbs and still did not feel cramped. I would encourage all my friends to fly British if they want to have a very comfortable flight from the US to Europe. Thank You British Airways, very good service indeed.",yes,2018,0.001799593,0.014701984,0.9834984,6
2018-06-07,Business Class,  This is the first time I have flown BA's Club Europe flying from London Heathrow to Corfu. I was not expecting a great deal having read a lot of less than positive reviews online however I was very pleasantly surprised. Shortly after boarding we were offered a welcome drink with a bag of nuts and a choice of magazine to read. Not long after this there was a full drinks service followed but a 4 course meal which was very tasty. I had cured salon followed by chicken breast then ginger cheesecake and a small cheese plate. We were then offered a choice of hot drinks and a top up of champagne. The crew were very attentive and helpful. They had a smile on their face all the time and the flight seemed to zip past. The seats were the usual economy seats with the middle blanked by a tray but for a relatively short trip it was fine. This flight was an upgrade using Avios and I would happily do it again. I paid around 6500 avios and an extra £13 in taxes which I think was very good value for what I had.,yes,2018,0.0032000304,0.025910169,0.97088975,2
2018-06-05,Business Class,"  Washington to Bucharest return via London. I was originally booked in World Traveller Plus but at Dulles check-in was offered a Club World upgrade at just $499 more which I accepted - resulting flight was very comfortable with good food and top-drawer service. The two London-Bucharest sectors both went well. But all this was just a prelude to my return trip. While in Bucharest I sustained a fall and although I wasn't seriously hurt it was still difficult to walk long distances especially with heavy luggage. At the Bucharest airport bag drop the agent noticed my situation and offered assistance, which I accepted - and was promptly wheeled through security, passport control and the (very long) corridors to the gate, then put aboard the plane. On arrival in London I was met by more assistance to whisk me through the vastness of T5 and onto the plane, this time with the pleasant surprise of another Club World upgrade (this time for free). Once on the plane back to Washington the cabin crew couldn't do enough for me, checking how I was doing, going through meal choices (the menu this time round was a bit heavy on cheese and other dairy items I really can't eat but ultimately I still ate well), getting me drinks, and more. They were as professional and proactive a crew as I've ever experienced in 40 years of long-haul travel. Finally, once arrived at Dulles more assistance was waiting, right up to getting my cab. What could have been an ordeal on this return trip was turned into as relaxing and satisfying a travel experience as can be imagined - through the years I've had mostly excellent experiences with BA cabin crews and that's a big reason why I've stayed with BA all these years and will continue to do so. But a big standing ovation for the cabin and ground crews for these flights for above-and-beyond service - you're the best.",yes,2018,0.024978185,0.19112927,0.7838925,-1

Very good seat with great extras that you would expect in 1st Class. Chose to sleep as it was a night flight, but had a delicious full breakfast in the morning. Baggage allowance was superb with 3 x 32Kg cases and 2 cabin bags. Overall, a lovely flight, with a great airline, that has a great crew",yes,2018,0.0013820202,0.011093113,0.98752487,0
2018-05-30,Economy Class,"  London Heathrow to Singapore on 28 May 2018. In this review, I am reviewing the a la carte dining option on board for World Traveller. World Traveller passengers have the option to pre-order from a selection of 6 main courses up to 30 days in advance for selected long haul flights out of LHR with prices ranging from £15 to £18. I had the Gourmet Dining consisting of braised Hertfordshire beef cheek which was succulent and delicious. If you do not want to risk not getting your meal of choice on a long haul BA flight and if this a la carte option is available on your route, I highly recommend you to go for it.",yes,2018,0.019332042,0.30366343,0.67700446,-1

2018-05-18,Economy Class,"  This was an early morning flight from Heathrow to Keflavik. The flight was not very full. Shortly after take off, the cabin crew came around to sell M&S snacks and drinks reasonably priced. This was a typical intra-European flight on British Airways where food and drinks are for sale.

2018-05-08,Economy Class,"  Chicago to London Heathrow. I was dubious about flying BA especially after my last flight over a year ago - after which I left the aircraft feeling very hungry. However my trip to USA with BA was surprisingly very good both ways. On this flight, after deciding not to spend on an upgrade, I was pleasantly surprised by being given a seat with extra leg room - didn't feel the need to get up and stretch my legs once. Although I slept a lot of the way, the cabin crew were very helpful - even asking the captain to find the direction of Mecca so I could pray (in my seat). Was given two bags of pretzels and two cups of coffee - i had to ask for both, but was given without any fuss. A380 is a very nice aircraft and the take off and landing was excellent, although I noticed a funny (not that loud) motorised noise coming form the galley noise of the journey. For dinner there was butter chicken, rice and lentils, and a rice pudding type desert, all of which was okay - nothing special.",yes,2018,0.0116022695,0.065631784,0.922766,5
2018-04-28,Business Class," Madrid to London. Credit where it's due. Flew club Europe and the crew were excellent. Friendly, attentive and professional. The food was a good standard.

2018-04-16,Economy Class,"  Miami to London. My most recent BA experience was positive. I fly BA for work and leisure up to 4 long haul flights a year. On my most recent flight from Miami to LHR I found the whole economy experience well above average, despite the dated aircraft the 747-400. Which to me is the legend of the skies! The cabin crew in economy were smart, attentive and seemed to go beyond the call of duty giving an elite service, from the MIA ground handling American crew. Food and beverage service was good, seating in my aisle seat 29E generous for my long legs. I recently flew BA business/ Club world to the Far East for work and despite the unlimited catering and frills the cabin staff lacked the attention and friendliness of this flight. Well done BA you excel against the North American carriers on routes to the North American gateways who give just a basic service.",yes,2018,0.01725705,0.108061425,0.87468153,6
2018-04-15,Economy Class,"  Gatwick to Barbados in December 2017. On a 9 hour flight they provided one meal, and afternoon tea which consisted of a mars bar and a cup of tea.

2018-04-05,Premium Economy," Efficient check in helpful staff advised on best lounge option for our flight. Decided to opt for premium economy as only 4 hour flight from London Heathrow to Cairo. Galleries South lounge was relatively quiet good range of snacks including an afternoon tea offering which was quite good. Showers clean and well presented. Chaotic boarding. Well presented aircraft, staff in premium economy cabin offered welcome drink. Slightly delayed departure time made up en route. Unable to order main course for meal on line but got choice of meal which was totally acceptable. Efficient staff and good inflight entertainment. Happy with whole experience.

However, from the moment I arrived at the check in desk in Tampa I was met with the utmost courtesy and assistance. From the check in clerk at business class waving me forward to use his terminal things just went from excellent to exceptional. I was helped to put my suitcase onto the conveyor scale and assisted with every step of the way until the aircraft door. Every person was polite, helpful and went out of their way to make my journey as pleasant as possible. I witnessed such kindness and this is what I have come to expect and value from British Airways.

Priority boarding worked well and even though the flight was full there was no overhead locker range. The inflight meal was prawns was generous along with a good selection of wine. Off loading was straightforward. The return flight was on time, the pre booked emergency seat had more leg room the premium seat. M&S food service was OK. The cabin crews were slow at taking payment.

2018-03-24,Business Class," London Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale is one of BA's new long-haul routes and clearly designed to cater for winter sun seekers. From September 2018, the Gatwick fleet will be 'densified', with an horrific ten across in economy and a reduced Club World. The 777-200 on our flight was of the bog-standard 90s vintage, which meant 48 pax squeezed into the Club World cabin and everyone having to make do with the ancient, small screen, low resolution IFE that required the usual rebooting. But there were positive aspects to the flight: a young and efficient cabin crew, the improved Club World food service with plates brought individually to one's seat, and arrival ahead of schedule, although this was let down by the delayed disembarkation that's commonplace at Fort Lauderdale terminal 4. Overall, an entirely reasonable flight.",yes,2018,0.010276625,0.14611758,0.8436058,1
2018-03-24,Business Class,"  London to Helsinki, Business class, Friday 23rd March. I thought service in the sky had died out. As a frequent flyer I haven’t felt the needed to complain nor commend until now. I had to say something, to say thank you for one of the most pleasurable flights I have ever had. This is old school airline service, puts the glamour and luxury back into air travel. Cabin staff made me feel like I was the only person they were serving. I loved the humour, the way they made it so personal and the fact they took such great care of my daughter who is as fussy as fussy comes. ",yes,2018,0.012312405,0.042863917,0.94482374,3

Words cannot express my gratitude and appreciation for the lovely crew that worked so hard to make sure I was comfortable on my latest flight; but here it goes! I was very sick/nauseas from food poisoning on a different airline and the staff off British Airways literally nursed me back to health.

The business lounge was quiet when we were there, however, food options were very limited, we were there in the morning, the food options for breakfast were hot meals or some plain toast or a couple of sandwich options. Onboard, service was really good, quite personal and attentive, which made a difference from the service on the way out to Beijing.

2018-03-11,Business Class," Warsaw to London. WAW is not a pleasant airport and the one lounge after passport control “Bolero” is always overcrowded so that benefit of flying club is not worth much at this airport. BA have changed their boarding process to group numbers and it went smoothly. Seat in club Europe is a standard coach class seat on a very tight pitch - frankly it’s pretty poor to sell this as a business class product with such seats. The service was very good, attentive and prompt. The food served was also good with a choice of main course, appetizer, desert and cheese course with drinks flowing, frankly well above expected.",yes,2018,0.09996021,0.25005051,0.64998925,-1

Boarding was smooth and we left on time. Food and drink was fine apart from breakfast which consisted of a cream cheese roll, which is not very pleasant any time and certainly not early in morning and a granary bar which I didn't eat, my dog liked it when I got home. For the price, you would expect a better meal. IFE was fine. Crew good.

2018-02-15,Economy Class," A fairly average flight to Cape Town and return. The old 777s they use out of Gatwick are incredibly dated but the economy seats are fairly comfortable. The TV screen is very small and fuzzy (and had to be reset on the journey home to get it working) but the selection of entertainment is OK. The food has noticeably improved since last time we flew with British Airways long haul and all meals were tasty and a decent size and it was nice to receive a hot breakfast before arrival on both journeys. As always with BA the crew were mixed – some were helpful and really friendly, others were borderline rude. However I would probably still choose BA to Cape Town in order to fly direct.",no,2018,0.016621733,0.12321174,0.86016655,-1
2018-02-13,Business Class," Flew BA 1311 on February 10th, from Aberdeen to London Heathrow. Check in was fast and efficient as was the boarding process. I really like the new Group boarding structure. The lunch offered on board was good. Cabin crew were very attentive. We arrived in London Heathrow Terminal 5 approx. 10 minutes ahead of schedule, however it took my luggage over 25 minutes to arrive. Overall very good with the exception of late arrival of luggage.",yes,2018,0.00214859,0.018640839,0.97921056,-1
2018-02-12,Business Class,"  Dusseldorf to London. Very satisfied with BA, Reasonable fares, on time, awesome cabin staff, going to the UK they are my favourite airline.

2018-02-09,Economy Class," I really enjoyed my flight from London to Johannesburg. The aircraft was very comfortable and the crew were friendly and polite. In inflight entertainment had a wide selection. The food was ok but nothing to get excited about, I did eat all of it though. As I have grown older I have found long haul flights less tolerable so I was not really looking forward to this flight, however I was very pleasantly surprised and will definitely use British Airways on that route again.",yes,2018,0.009759045,0.02864013,0.9616009,0
2018-02-05,Economy Class," We flew British Airways 194 and BA 197 into/out of Heathrow late Jan 2018, seats 27F/H and 30F/H respectively. Seats were comfortable but the electronic boxes took up some of the legroom. Food was OK, this is coach, so no really high expectations. Plane was clean, flight attendants were friendly. The IFE worked flawlessly, good selection of programs. Bathrooms were maintained clean throughout entire flight. We had beverage runs about every 1.5 hrs, if you wanted anything else, snacks were available in galley. BA did a good job.",yes,2018,0.004452135,0.06928025,0.92626756,-1
2018-01-31,Economy Class,  Johannesburg to Cape Town. A really basic flight operated by Comair. No inflight entertainment. You had a USB plug to charge your phone.

2018-01-29,Business Class," Flew on BA 1414 from London Heathrow to Belfast City Airport, January 16th. Check in was fast and efficient as was the boarding process. Breakfast offered on board was good and tasty. We arrived in Belfast 5 minutes ahead of schedule and luggage was out within 10 minutes.

2018-01-17,Business Class,"  London to Bangkok. I was a bit apprehensive about flying BA Club World due to the bad reviews the airline has received recently. Boarding at Heathrow was well organised due to their group boarding policy. On board I offered a pre Champagne or water. Once airborne choose gin and tonic and cashew nuts. Meal pre ordered online. I found all three courses exceptional and very well cooked. The staff worked tireless right through the twelve hour flight. I know BA Club Seats are not ideal, but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any Middle East airline I have flown with. Entertainment screen poor and needs urgent revamp, cannot see when lights are on in the cabin. Very nice to see a mixed aged crew that shows ageism does not exist at BA. I also must commend BA for their quick medical response to a passenger who had collapsed on the aircraft in club. There rapid response and actions probably saved his life, I flew on 12 January. Well done BA, you are pulling in the right direction again.",yes,2018,0.047468115,0.20151782,0.75101405,2
2018-01-17,Business Class," What I have to say. “To fly, to serve”, a very well respected motto. British Airways is always a good choice. I was flying business class from LGW to FCO, everything was excellent! The crew were really nice for the whole flight, I was travelling solo and I had a long conversation with a steward on board while he was serving the food. We got a varied and luxury food and beverage choice (I got champagne and salmon!) everything was lly tasty. We departed and landed on time (with direct connection to terminal with finger in both the airports, and I really appreciate this every time.) So, what to say, British Airways is always a warranty and is with no doubt one of the best European airlines. Their success is surely deserved.",yes,2018,0.0021547826,0.013399647,0.9844455,6
2018-01-16,Business Class," San Jose, CA to London Heathrow round-trip in Club World. Had originally booked in Premium Economy but received upgrade offers from British Airways that were too go to pass up. Extremely happy and impressed with level of service provided. Glass of champagne upon boarding, premium whiskies and a nice fillet of steak for dinner. Cabin crew came by constantly to see how I was doing on both legs. Lie flat seat gave me 5+ hours of sleep on both flights. The seat itself was not as wide as I anticipated and the lie flat bed can feel somewhat claustrophobic but legroom is no issue. The 787-9 is a fantastic aircraft. Comfortable and quiet. Fast track passes an added plus. Flying out of San Jose is a bonus since I'm a ten minute drive to home. Overall very pleased with British Airways and the service provided. Access to lounges at both airports another plus ! No complaints from me. Will look to fly BA again later this year. Just hope they have more offers for Business Class.",yes,2018,0.0052202716,0.031924784,0.9628549,-1
2018-01-09,Economy Class," Flew British Airways from Rotterdam to London City. Our trip started with a delay due to a technical problem, but we were promptly rebooked on the next flight which took off a little over an hour later, so that was not a big problem. Nice aircraft with good legroom and a friendly crew, providing a drink and a snack on this 40min flight. Inbound flight had a delay of 45 mins again because an other plane had a technical problem so on that point BA needs to improve. Also check in via BA-app didn't work both ways, so again there's room for improvement. Would still recommend especially on this route because of the short check-in times and short walkways at Rotterdam and London City. Price can be high though, especially when you have checked luggage, but we hadn't and I booked well in advance. Paid 200 euros rtn for two, which was fine. The advantage of London City is, apart from the distance to London, that you do not have to pay for an expensive train ride.",yes,2018,0.08642068,0.3040565,0.6095228,-1
2018-01-08,First Class," The First Class cabins are in need of refurbishment, but since this aircraft type is ageing this might been a pointless wish. The seats were very comfortable and completely functional. Entertainment choices were current, varied, and easy to access although the earphone supplied were not of the noise cancelling variety. The cabin staff was remarkably efficient and very kind. The food for dinner, while not overgenerous in choice was delicious and well presented with the option of dining at your own convenience. The breakfast menu was surprising in the variety of choices offered. Overall, an extremely pleasant experience. There is no Wi-Fi available on this aircraft type.",yes,2018,0.0076011247,0.04423329,0.9481656,4
2018-01-05,Economy Class,"  London to Johannesburg. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the flight was from LHR-JNB, I booked this flight as it was a direct flight, and although it was around £130 more than Emirates and Qatar airways, it saved around 10 hours off of the journey. The A380 seats were reasonably comfortable and I had plenty of leg room, the cabin crew were professional and prompt when requested. Inflight entertainment was ok with a good selection of movies (they do need updating though as some were released early 2017), lack of onboard WiFi is a big letdown too. Food was standard airline food, neither good or bad but ok. BA has been taken over for air travel by the big middle Eastern airlines, but this flight was good and would have no problem flying them again - long haul only.",yes,2018,0.015936531,0.09413015,0.88993335,0
2017-12-30,First Class,"  Hong Kong to London before Christmas in First Class. Boarding was a little chaotic. There was no priority for First class passengers. Maybe the flight was fully booked. Cabin crew was very attentive and efficient. Service was excellent. BA does not have the best first class product, but their staff is the best in Europe. Food was tasteful and wine selection was superb. I had very good 9 hours sleep before landing punctually at LHR. Looking forward to flying with them again in January.",yes,2017,0.007996852,0.04267495,0.94932824,0
2017-12-22,Premium Economy," London Heathrow to Hong Kong on the A380 a couple of weeks ago. I flew in Premium Economy, which was obtained through points. The seats were comfy and felt quite spacious, however I am quite a small person. Glasses of champagne/wine offered on arrival, and the food was quite good. The attendants were polite. Inflight entertainment was decent, I especially liked the ""Festive Season"" section, which had a variety of holiday/Christmas movies. Plane left and arrived on time. Having had several negative experiences with British Airways in the past, I was pleasantly surprised with this flight.",yes,2017,0.0054790215,0.04706631,0.94745463,-1
2017-12-09,Business Class," Great flight out from London to Santiago. Lovely, friendly crew. Goats cheese salad to start, fish pie for main, good selection of wines and managed 7 hrs sleep on way out and even longer coming back! 787-900 is a fantastic aircraft even if you do have to climb over some feet to get out, the window seats are very private. Flying this aircraft to Seychelles in May and really looking forward to it. Just waiting to try the new bedding now and catering.

2017-12-05,Premium Economy,"  London to Seattle, a seamless flight which was on time and little to complain about.

2017-11-30,Business Class," Flew London Heathrow to New York JFK. Have flown this route a number of times with British Airways, but this was my first experience with the new Club World offerings (White Company bedding, improved catering, refurbished 747 club world cabin). The new improvements are excellent, particularly the catering. Both the presentation and the taste of the new food is a significant step above the previous Club World catering offering and the new ‘pick your starter and desert’ options from the display trolley is a real nice touch. The new bedding makes the Club World bed much more comfortable to sleep on.",yes,2017,0.0012782635,0.016274072,0.9824477,2
2017-11-30,Economy Class," Flew Funchal to London Gatwick. Just wanted to thank the staff on the aircraft for retrieving my game console, was a pleasure to fly with a great airline like British Airways. I left my console on the flight, once I realised that I have left it behind I headed over to the help desk which is located in the baggage control area. The staff were friendly and happy to assist me, the gentlemen made a call and while this was happening the air hostess appeared with my console in hand. This has really made me appreciate flying with a high quality airline. Future flights to Madeira are most certainly going to be with British Airways.",yes,2017,0.002229335,0.02212407,0.97564656,-1
2017-11-23,First Class,"  Cape Town to London. I can report a positive experience on our flight. From the moment we boarded, cabin crew were polite and efficient, and provided a high-class service throughout. Seats 4E/F suffer a bit from poor storage space and a lack of privacy, but they are the best for a couple. Glasses were kept topped-up even before take-off. The menu provided four choices of both starter and mains, and all the dishes were both well-presented and well-cooked. Talking to cabin crew, it seems that staff are now being trained to prepare and present food with greater care, and this really showed on the flight. The IFE screen was the usual low resolution with a limited selection of films. Still no WiFi, of course. Take-off and landing was on schedule, and announcements from the cockpit had that typical air of friendly professionalism. An excellent flight, overall.",yes,2017,0.009484194,0.07466516,0.9158507,-1
2017-11-17,Business Class,"  Flew British Airways from London Heathrow to Johannesburg. Plane at T5 Satellite C, so used B Galleries Lounge, which was quiet and pleasant. Efficient boarding, seats 50J/K on upper deck, which provided good privacy despite proximity to toilets. Mixed crew FAs and ours were young and enthusiastic. In-flight service good, with a notable improvement in the quality of food, i.e., courses delivered individually to seats and main courses not cooked to a crisp. IFE lagging behind that offered by competitors, with small screens and limited movies. Breakfast included four hot options which were more palatable than usual. Overall, a good flight, although we look forward to promised improvements in 2018.",yes,2017,0.0055327513,0.060649708,0.9338175,-1
2017-11-14,Business Class,"  London to Philadelphia. Ticket booked was an AMEX companion ticket so effectively family of 4 travelled for £2.5k in business class return so very good value. Positives - B747 on both journeys was refurbished so very clean and great IFE. Cabin quiet and crew amazingly helpful. T5 Lounge fine, flight on time. Bags off very quickly. Negatives - food on on both legs wasn't great. Salad poor and main beef meal very average. Pudding which is normally the show stopper - not great. In previous years food been excellent. Return journey just the same - except for the crew this time being outstandingly helpful. We were travelling with a baby and a toddler and the crew couldn't do enough to help. The real test of the crew was on landing at LHR, we were walking up the jetty and my 3 year old daughter was sick all over me. We were stood on the jetty trying to sort the situation and all the crew after a long flight came to help us. They were amazing. They didn't have to as they were done for the day. BA are getting so much stick at the moment - their hard product is fine if you are redeeming a companion ticket but not if you are paying in excess of £15k. The crew lift this product to a much higher level.",yes,2017,0.0589077,0.19585377,0.74523854,-1
2017-11-03,Business Class," British Airways appear to be taking positive steps to lift their game. The service on this flight was flight was materially better than that previously experienced. The quality of the food served had lifted materially. The staff were helpful. The big downside is that Club Europe sets remains stock standard economy seats - with the middle seat blocked off. The pitch is tight - too tight in my view. Another couple of centimetres would be welcome. Overall, a better BA experience.",yes,2017,0.03176408,0.1531637,0.81507224,2
2017-10-30,Economy Class,"  This was my first time flying with British Airways from Los Angeles to London Heathrow. I was able to secure a window seat for myself (without paying any fee) during online check-in 24 hours prior to departure. The baggage drop-off experience at LAX and LHR was smooth. At LAX, the BA staff tags your check-in bags, at LHR, you have to do it yourself. The on-board experience was good. This was my first time sitting on the upper-deck of A380 (which had a special storage bin by the window armrest). Food options were consistent with what you find on most transatlantic flights (Chicken or Pasta). There was no WiFi, but BA had a good collection of movies. I enjoyed BA's in-flight ""movie snack"" as well. The ""Flight Map / Tracker"" wasn't working on one segment, which was a bit surprising. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and would consider flying with BA again.",yes,2017,0.0052257124,0.053168457,0.9416058,-1
2017-10-29,Economy Class,  Gatwick to Cagliari proved to be a rather pleasant and well organised affair. The website was easy to use and very clear. I checked-in online and simply had to drop off my bag. I arrived very early for the flight and noted that there was quite a queue already. The boarding process was quick and efficient and the interior of the aircraft was clean. My seat was comfortable for a short flight. The captain made clear and informative announcements and the two crew I could see worked very hard and were pleasant. The crew made use of Italian and were cheerful and professional. My gripe is the awful use of Marks and Spencer food. This has to be purchased and a good few items were not available. There were no route maps and no entertainment systems. The lavatory was clean. Disembarkation was managed well.,yes,2017,0.0528861,0.1981706,0.74894327,1
2017-10-21,Economy Class,"  London City to Edinburgh. Flight left on-time and arrived early. Impressed with the legroom on the Embraer 190 (much more comfortable than BA's A320s). Check-in, security and boarding all went smoothly and quickly. Cabin crew were efficient. Light snack and drink provided on this short flight. Would fly with BA again on short sectors, and LCY is an excellent airport to use.",yes,2017,0.0025430385,0.04166363,0.9557933,0
2017-10-20,Business Class,"  Faro to Gatwick. Check in was quiet at the club Europe desk and I was very quickly booked in. Fast track security at the airport wasn’t particularly well managed, although I did get through quicker than I would have otherwise. Disappointingly British Airways do not provide any lounge access at Faro, and there is currently a lot of construction taking place in the main departure lounge, and the builders are not exactly considerate with the noise! There was no priority queue at the entrance to the gate and as usual British Airways did a fairly half hearted job at ensuring priority boarding of the aircraft itself. The aircraft was the new style, which I think is very smart and nicely decorated (not budget airline as some commentators like to say), and whilst the legroom isn’t amazing I am 6’ tall and was quite comfortable and having the extra table space makes it a more usable space. The cabin crew were very friendly and professional whilst also being very efficient. A bar service with nuts was delivered soon after take off along with the menu for the flight. All of the cold parts of the meal and the drinks were excellent, sadly the chicken main was quite overcooked leading to dry chicken and soggy veg. That being said it tasted very nice. Arriving into Gatwick was a dream, especially for a large airport. Although the buildings are quite old and not laid out as well as newer ones, they have done a fantastic job at modernising it and making security very quick. It took a little while for bags to reach the belt but priority bags all came out first so the process was fairly painless. I got a good deal on the flight so I would say it was reasonably good value for money, although the experience in Faro airport does reduce the premium feel considerably.",yes,2017,0.074052766,0.22107974,0.70486754,1
2017-10-19,Business Class,"  Malaga to Gatwick. Our return trip from holiday was equally pleasant. Check-in at Malaga was a breeze although security was packed even though a quiet Sunday. VIP lounge at Malaga used by BA and other airlines (apparently its the only one there) is pretty useless compared with the old BA lounge that used to be there - cost cutting ?? Guess we were spoiled by Gatwick !! Drink okay but limited, food pretty awful but seating comfortable and it is very spacious. Flight left on time and again arrived half an hour early due I guess to help from Hurricane Ophelia which I guess we were on the fringe of. In board catering and drinks up to the usual quality and very pleasant crew - chatted to the First Officer, nice man. All in all we were well looked after in this Class so can't complain.",yes,2017,0.07675427,0.2250067,0.698239,1
2017-10-15,Business Class,"  Gatwick to Faro. Pretty good flight all round, and as ticket was bought in sale with car hire as well, it worked out good value. Check in area at south terminal is very nice and I was checked in very quickly, with fast track security equally quick. The new BA lounge is really well decorated and laid out with lots of nice and varied seating, interesting light fixtures and good views of the tarmac. It was early morning and breakfast was served, which was reasonably good. Although the hot options were just bacon roll, omelette roll or porridge which felt quite limited. Staff were all excellent. Boarding was quick, cabin crew friendly although no pre flight drink at all offered. This was an older aircraft with the old style seating, but the aircraft was clean and didn’t show much sign of age. The seats are comfortable enough, although legroom is not amazing. I was lucky enough to be in the front row so had more than most. The cooked breakfast was actually fairly good I think, nothing world shattering but decently cooked and fairly good quality ingredients. Disembarkation was quick enough, although bags took quite a while. Priority baggage didn’t seem to count for a lot, and annoyingly my priority bag tag had come off and ended up being one of the last bags. Overall a good flight.",yes,2017,0.013497536,0.07637699,0.91012543,1
2017-10-08,Economy Class,"  Orlando to Gatwick. The staff that looked after us flying out to Florida and home were outstanding, on the way home the seating had been already arranged and my seat was separate from my two children, I was really worried about flying home away from my children, I spoke to the flight supervisor who kindly asked two passengers if they would switch seats which they were happy to do. The seats were very good and went back enough so you were able to get to sleep, the only thing we weren’t to happy with was the movies but I guess you can’t have everything. All in all I would book to fly with BA again and would highly recommend.",yes,2017,0.017460365,0.10360668,0.87893295,0
2017-10-01,Economy Class, My early morning flight from Gatwick to Malaga was a very pleasant experience overall. The flight departed on time and was staffed by competent and amiable and very experienced cabin crew. Announcements were clear and friendly. However there was no route map and many of the snacks listed on the Marks and Spencer to buy menu were not available at all. I must mention that the cost of the luggage was outrageous and off putting.,yes,2017,0.13746212,0.2527885,0.60974944,1
2017-09-24,Economy Class,"  Gatwick to Tirana. Full flight on both outward and return journey. The seating was adequate for a short journey but only limited pitch. The aircraft was clean. Cabin crew were present and friendly throughout the journey but busy selling food and on board goods. The main advantage of this airline was the direct flight from UK to Tirana, otherwise nothing special to recommend. Both flights on time.",no,2017,0.011091784,0.12112045,0.86778784,1
2017-09-22,Economy Class,"  Kuala Lumpur to Berlin via London. Aircraft long haul new and clean, short haul a bit old, but still acceptable. Crew overall are lovely, pleasant service. BA food is on the top of the rank. Kuala Lumpur to London My boyfriend and I got beef stew and chicken satay as dinner and beef omelette as breakfast. Also very tasty. We got 2 wines and so many juices. Return flight was chicken curry and pesto pasta. Again, it flavorful. And we got beef congee and Engliah breakfast before we landed. Short hauls don't have any food. Inflight entertainment not the best, but still acceptable. Short hauls don't have any screens. Only thing I don't like is the seats. Economy seats are small. I have no problem with it since I am a petite girl, but still very uncomfortable to sit straight up. If I knew before, I will book a premium economy, that one seems nicer and have more space. I got the best price for round trip, value for money!",yes,2017,0.11710288,0.28108862,0.6018085,-1
2017-09-21,Economy Class,  I flew from Brussels to London Heathrow on an A320. The aircraft was about three quarters full. Boarding was smooth and we left and arrived slightly early.

2017-09-19,Economy Class,"  Heathrow to Bilbao. Boarding of the flight at Heathrow was very good , the flight was on time and the plane was clean. Frequent flyers boarded first and the rest soon followed. From then on the service was very similar to a Easy Jet or Eurowings flight. The 3 crew member's in economy passed through the cabin selling M&S sandwiches , snacks and coffee. The flight out of Bilbao was delayed by a late incoming aircraft, information on the delay was a little slow in coming from the gate agent. However the crew were very efficient loading the flight when it finally landed. The flight crew also managed to shave 15 minutes off the flight time too. However the service onboard is similar to Eurowings. Both flights were safe and competent. But the actual flight experience was lacking and in future I will consider Easyjet or similar as they offer the same level of service for less money.",no,2017,0.030669922,0.2146669,0.75466317,-1
2017-09-16,Business Class,"  Flew London Heathrow to Kalamata. Slow boarding on this new BA destination in Greece. Club Europe seats uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight, particularly when the seat in front is inclined just before the meal service. No IFE. Cabin crew were professional and attentive throughout. Lunch service definitely improved, although the lacto-ovo-vegetarian main course was the usual bland, overcooked pasta. Arrival on schedule and through to car hire within ten minutes of landing. Overall, a reasonable flight, although Club Europe is poor value by competitors' business class standards.",no,2017,0.065942414,0.32134897,0.61270857,2
2017-09-11,Economy Class,  London Heathrow to Biarritz. Had a very nice flight with good cabin service and informative cockpit crew.

2017-09-09,Business Class,"  Zakinthos to London Heathrow. Poor check in at Zante airport. Not enough desks, slightly clueless staff. Mrs B had to deploy laser beams to get front row which was free. Slightly late departure and made to wait on hot bus for while before boarding. After that very good flight again. Much busier Club cabin than on way out so two staff but they were still very attentive. Beetroot carpaccio with Goats cheese, melt in mouth Ox Cheek, poor desert again. Again the crew were really good about helping my nervous wife with the female co-pilot coming out to chat. Not left wanting the whole flight. A bug bear on both flights were the economy passengers using the club toilet at will. This kept disrupting the cabin service and made my little one nearly have a problem because of the extra queues. One pays more for more toilets. Kids in dire need, ok, adults No! Time made up almost, T5 quite quick again so another good experience for us with BA.

2017-09-09,Economy Class,"  Flew British Airways from Belfast City to London Heathrow. First time I flew from Belfast and it's a great little airport. I had access to the BA lounge, which for such a small airport is pretty good. It was an evening flight and there were a decent choice of cold sandwiches including: chicken, smoked salmon, egg, etc. The bar was well stocked including Fever Tree tonic and Grey Goose vodka. Champagne was available on request. Due to a flight delay our plane did not depart from the air bridge, but at gate 6, but we could access this gate using stairs from the lounge, this was managed well as we were given priority boarding before general boarding was announced in the main terminal. The flight was probably at 30% capacity so the FA had no problems serving passengers. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes but we made some time and was at the gate at Heathrow 20 minutes late. This was a last minute booking for business and was pretty expensive at £343 return. But as a Gold member I got most of the business class benefits.",yes,2017,0.02339232,0.17739084,0.79921675,-1
2017-09-09,Business Class,"  Toronto to London Heathrow and was very pleasantly surprised. BA Lounge in terminal 3 at Pearson is small but quiet compared to others. Great window seats overlooking tarmac. Separate meal service area prior to flight allowed me to focus on sleep during this red-eye that left at 22:00. Meal in lounge was buffet style but had a really good made to order noodle bar. Drink choices perfectly adequate. Staff very helpful and cordial. Flight left half an hour late but made up time and landed early. Cabin staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The seats must be the most talked about issue for BA club world. They do indeed ""pack them in"" compared to any other business class flight I have taken. That said, seats fully reclined, I had no issues with faulty equipment and it was very comfortable. Aside from take-off and morning meal service privacy screen never came down between me and fellow traveler. Cost of flight was 30-50% less than other business class options available to me so with this in mind experience was very good. As a side note connected on to Madrid and BA lounges at LHR are fantastic. W",yes,2017,0.0050295116,0.040015984,0.9549545,-1
2017-09-09,Business Class,"  London Heathrow to Zakinthos. From parking meet and greet to inside the Lounge via bag drop, security and three shops took only 50 minutes. Boarding on time, greeted warmly. Managed to grab the front row at online check in. From take off the Purser looked after the business cabin brilliantly. Drinks and nibbles out sharpish and refreshed without asking. Meal served quickly. Carpaccio of melon with a prawn, miso cod, not overcooked, wasabi mash and veg. Average dessert and cheese and crackers. Wine topped up regularly. Coffee in a mug. All through the flight staff looked after my nervous flyer wife and little four year old with great care and attention as well as the rest of the cabin. Priority offload and separate bus to terminal. Fairly quick passport control and bags coming onto the belt as we got through. The crew had been very kind and chatty with us and in good humor. Apart from delay in leaving Heathrow FAB.",yes,2017,0.0060153906,0.09812977,0.89585483,5
2017-09-06,Economy Class,"  London to Vancouver. I booked our trip with them as the price was unbeatable. Our outward flight to Vancouver was delayed by approx an hour. We were seated on the top deck and I was impressed by the room we had (window/Aisle and 3 middle seats). The crew were great with our young sons offering them extra drinks, pillows etc. Food was OK (the kids Mac cheese was better than the adult meals). Entertainment was good and flight was smooth most of the way. On our return flight we again had a delay of about an hour but 45 mins of that was made up thanks to a strong tail wind. Again we were on the top deck and it was so quiet up there it was lovely. Food was again just ok. We had an incident where my son spilt a bottle of Fanta all over himself midflight when everyone was asleep. He was drenched and I had no spare clothes for him. I spoke to a wonderful member of crew who couldn't be more helpful. She found some first class PJs for him to change into and gave him a couple of extra goodies and she checked up on us a few times after that commenting how good he had been throughout the flight. She really made what could have been a stressful situation much easier and her positive friendly attitude really helped me out. I was pleasently surprised by BA on both legs of our journey and I wouldn't hesitate to book with them again, just a shame they can't up their game food wise.",yes,2017,0.0081772925,0.047427446,0.94439524,-1
2017-08-31,Business Class,"  London Heathrow to Keflavik was a good experience. Club Europe cabin was not really a business class cabin, but economy with the centre seat converted into a table. Other than a lack of leg room and reduced seat recline the cabin was fine. The meals served was very good with a simple starter, decent hot main course and tasty dessert. There was endless drinks and hot drinks available during the flight. The senior cabin crew looking after the cabin were very good and could not do enough for you. The cabin was clean in both directions. Boarding the plane both in London and Keflavik was straightforward.",yes,2017,0.003561142,0.031347994,0.9650908,-1
2017-08-28,Economy Class,"  San Jose to London Gatwick return. The outward flight was delayed for an hour at San Jose due to poor weather but the pilot kept passengers informed of the situation at regular intervals. On the flight I was lucky enough to have two empty seats alongside my aisle seat as the man in the seat directly in front of mine reclined his seat fully as soon as we took off, making it impossible to hold a book at reading distance and then jiggled and bounced as he watched the IFE - it would have been a miserable flight without a seat to move along to. The cabin staff were friendly and efficient and did not disappear after the meal service but answered passengers calls and made the rounds with water and fruit juice. The food was of good quality so it was, despite the delay, a good experience. On the return, boarding was swift and efficient, and the cabin staff, once again, friendly and helpful. Food not as interesting as on the outward leg, but perfectly acceptable. I usually try to take a cheaper flight, involving connections, but this direct flight was well worth the extra expense.",yes,2017,0.04481785,0.17908801,0.7760942,1
2017-08-24,Economy Class,"  Amsterdam to Gatwick. Check in was easy thanks to fast help from the check-in desk. The staff at the gate were friendly and ensured boarding did not take a huge amount of time. The welcome on board was exceptional, however the cabin crew service was quite regular for the remainder of the flight (ie, nothing exceptional or poor). The seats looked very appealing, but the seams at the point where the upright and horizontal parts of the seat meet are out of line and make it slightly uncomfortable to sit on after a while. This is a great shame for a good looking cabin. We took off twenty minutes after the intended time, due to a late start to boarding and an extended taxi time. However, the pilots did a great job in keeping us informed to the reason for the delay, and the current progress in making up the lost time. Overall the flight was pretty regular from BA, but the good ground staff, useful information as of the delay and friendly cabin crew, made it a good service.",yes,2017,0.088356785,0.26099038,0.6506528,-1
2017-08-21,Economy Class,"  Florence to Bristol. A positive first experience and I will try to fly BA in the future. When I booked the flight for myself and my 11 and 13 year olds I was automatically allocated seats (no charge), 23kg of checked luggage included at no additional charge yet the flights still worked out the cheapest. A few hours before the flight, during online check-in, I noticed my daughter's name mispelt on the ticket. I telephoned BA's 24 hour helpline and the ticket was changed and reissued within an hour and I received a call back with an update part way through the process (no charge and no hassle). All staff from customer services to ground staff to in-flight crew were friendly. Staff on the return flight went out of their way to try and help a young mum with an upset child. We were given a meal with water and a further drink on our 2h 20m flight. On this flight to Bristol everything is included in your ticket. We had soft drinks but a couple in-front had G&Ts. Our meal was salmon with couscous, bread, cheese and a mint. On the way back there was a choice of falafel and couscous or chicken salad with a chocolate brownie. The meals were actually really nice. Both our flights did depart late for different and, what I believe were, unavoidable reasons but we were given adequate explanations and our flight out to Italy still arrived early. Some explanation before boarding the return flight might have been helpful although nobody seemed concerned and it was passengers who hadn't got themselves to the gate that further held the flight up. I wasn't bothered which airline I flew with. My criteria were that I could fly from a local airport as cheaply as possible and BA came in cheaper than any of the other airlines for this particular flight. My criteria will still exist but I will certainly be looking at BA first in the future.",yes,2017,0.0244131,0.20230854,0.77327836,-1
2017-08-16,Premium Economy,"  Johannesburg to London Heathrow. Premium Economy very spacious with 38 inch seat pitch, very good IFE. The 2 crew serving this section were excellent: polite, engaging and fun. Amenity kits appreciated. Chicken curry was delicious- my brother and fellow traveller both advised their steaks were the best they had eaten on an airline. Impressed with warm bread rolls. Plenty of wine. Did not eat breakfast. Negatives being toilet and galley noise behind last row 38, elderly cabin, 8 abreast seating on Boeing 747 compared to 7 abreast on the A380. Outward from London to Johannesburg the upper-deck Premium Economy cabin on A380 is very personal and much more spacious and quieter than on Boeing 747 aircraft. Nice wide selection on IFE. Once again excellent, young and polite crew. Beef steak asparagus dinner and orange chocolate dessert was delicious. Negatives being inedible cold hard bun prior to landing in JNB, although hot breakfast was offered which I didn't partake in. Overall a very good experience and would recommend BA.",yes,2017,0.0038201006,0.03305509,0.9631248,-1
2017-07-27,Economy Class,"  Newcastle to Boston via London. Flight from Newcastle to Heathrow fine, although paying for a cup of tea with Avios was not especially slick. A superb flight from Heathrow to Boston, even though it was the day the latest BA strike started (19th July). Left slightly late due to Heathrow computer problems earlier in the day but we were kept fully informed about progress. Seats on B777-300 comfortable with plenty of legroom in the bassinet seats. Cabin crew thoughtful and highly professional and there were regular considerate, reassuring updates from the cockpit. Food really pretty good - dropping the second meal on this route is not a problem for me. Entertainment not bad at all. Had a very nice chat with the captain waiting for the bags to arrive in the airport. All BA crew were a credit to the airline and if this is the norm for BA, I would happily fly with them again soon.",yes,2017,0.0074574337,0.044229433,0.9483131,-1
2017-07-19,Economy Class,"  Gatwick to Bridgetown. I managed to locate some seats that offered reasonable leg room (I am over 6ft), although after feeling the knees of the passenger sitting behind me, I think he was not so lucky! We had a delay in take off but apologies provided. Food was okay and I was pleasantly surprised. Crew members were hard working, polite and professional. The Boeing 777-200was showing signs of age (G-VIIW ) but compared to the other aircraft we flew on last year, this plane appeared more cared for. I am concerned how BA are going to shoehorn 10 abreast instead of the current 9. I cannot conceive how physically eating a meal would be possible. Overall the experience was good on this occasion. The IFE was old, but worked, it did not last time. ",yes,2017,0.08163579,0.29934767,0.6190166,1
2017-07-16,Economy Class,"  A packed flight from Athens to London Heathrow. Cabin crew spent quite a bit of time selling food and drinks from a trolley. Everything had to be purchased. I had to go to the back for a glass of ""tap"" water - complimentary! Small TV screens hanging at intervals displayed the flight route. Minimal interaction with crew. Seat was fine. Bag space overhead was ample - no charge for that. Plane arrived on time which was a relief as I had to change terminals to catch a connection. I had two hours and made it. The travel was followed up by a customer survey by the airline. I was glad when the four hour flight ended - nothing special but at least it was on time and safely at that.",yes,2017,0.014138728,0.14550392,0.8403573,-1
2017-07-12,Economy Class,"  After flying Boston to London on the A380-800, I returned on a recently retrofitted Boeing 747-400. The 747 seats were newer and much more comfortable than those from my previous flights (they appeared to be the same ones in the economy section on the A380). The seatback TV and in-flight entertainment had been significantly upgraded. The only part of the cabin's aesthetics and comfort that was lacking was the overhead lights, which hadn't been replaced. The cabin crew was polite, professional, and accommodating – no complaints there. The captain even gave us a personal, genuine announcement before takeoff, which was appreciated given the amount of preparation necessary before a long-haul flight. The flight itself was comfortable at 6 hours, 59 minutes, and without delay on either end. While I'm a bit concerned that BA is at risk of turning into a low-cost carrier under the current leadership, my experience was that his crew are still doing a great job.

2017-07-10,Business Class,"  Return flights from Newcastle to Geneva via London Heathrow in Club Europe. Check in at Newcastle rapid without a queue. Fast track worked well. Lounge was ok, but limited selection of food. Onboard all flights, the domestic and European biz class is fine. Seats with decent legroom, choice of food (chicken salad, charcuterie and cheese) and good quality drinks. The staff were lovely, professional and good humoured despite having a lot of service to deliver on short sectors. Crew from GVA-LHR particularly good with a biz passenger who became unwell and needed medical attention on arrival. All of this during the Mixed Fleet strike dates. T5 South Lounge at LHR was like a sauna, and access impossible from south security (involves a long walk downstairs then up again). North lounge better on return, but bathrooms generally dirty and in need of an update. Tagged priority bags were literally the last on the belt at Geneva which was a joke, but likely not BA's fault. First off back in Newcastle. Overall, the short haul business product is perfectly adequate, if for nothing other than skipping queues. BA's lounges are pretty poor compared to some of their competitors, but was very happy to see their crew still doing an excellent job.",yes,2017,0.042298753,0.15883714,0.79886407,-1
2017-07-09,Economy Class,"  London to Keflavik. The British Airways experience has certainly changed. I'm happy to pay less and still be treated like the staff are happy to see me and that's not always the case when flying with low cost airlines. Terminal 5 is one of the best terminals at Heathrow and as we were connecting from a long haul flight from Asia on another carrier we were a bit tired and travel weary when taking this morning flight. But the staff greeted us with a smile, the plane felt nice and seat was comfortable. It's bring your own entertainment and you'll have to purchase both food and drinks. Which we found to be comparatively good value for money and quite good. I like the BA service touch. It manages to be both nice and efficient. We had a nice smooth flight home to Iceland at the end of our vacation and I can honestly say that I'm looking forward to my next flight with BA.",yes,2017,0.0034250035,0.022747084,0.9738279,-1

The flight attendants were lovely, attentive, prompt and sweet. I'm a nervous flyer so I tend to drink a lot and I never felt judged or like I was bothering them by ordering another. The food was good, plenty of in-flight movie options and the pilot was very reassuring. I'm not really sure what else I could need.

2017-07-05,Economy Class,"  London Heathrow to Tallinn return. Flight on time on way out. Had changed seats to row 12 (emergency) loads of legroom and row in front can't recline, so it was very comfortable. Bought a nondescript coffee. Good flight. The flight home was a surprise using a Qatar Airways plane and crew due to BA strike. Row 12 not an emergency row but more legroom than is standard on BA, a better seat on a new plane, a decent free snack and a nice small bottle of wine also free! So a good experience.

2017-06-30,First Class,"  Just landed from the second of two flights in First between London and Kuala Lumpur and on both legs, the experience was exceptional. Chose seats 1E and 1F on both legs for my partner and I, and seats were clean, well maintained, fully functioning and very comfortable. Ground service at T5 is a vast improvement with the new First Wing; passed through quickly and met by attentive staff, with prompt and professional service in the Concorde Room. Golden Lounge at Kuala Lumpur less inspiring but staff very good and nice dinner menu. Onboard the staff on both legs were professional, friendly, intuitive, attentive and good natured, and they went out of their way to accommodate our dining requests. Flowers in the bathroom (which was kept clean, though a second bathroom would be helpful as had to wait at times) and amuse bouche provided. Plenty of wine, no shortage of food and nothing ran out - my glass was never empty and the crew knew when to make the bed up without having to ask. These flights reminded of why we fly with BA and remain loyal to them.",yes,2017,0.0025465712,0.028296676,0.96915674,-1
2017-06-16,Business Class,"  London to Valencia in an A319 in Club Europe. This was the first time we had flown British Airways since the move to the south terminal, check in was quick and progress through security also without delay. BA lounge was busy but still plenty of seating available. Refreshments in the lounge Ok, but nothing special. Boarding on time, cabin crew in Club Europe were very pleasant and efficient as I always find with BA. Meal service surprisingly good for a relatively short flight, three courses quite tasty including smoked salmon starter, Thyme Roasted chicken for main course and chocolate cheesecake, washed down with a couple of glasses of champagne. Note BA no longer use miniature bottle and pour as required from proper sized bottles. Cheese and crackers a bit sad and the cracker were soft. Plane landed ahead of schedule but priority baggage didn't work and our cases was about the last through. Overall a good flight.",yes,2017,0.009459487,0.07463075,0.91590977,2
2017-06-15,Economy Class,"  Brussels to Rome via London. There are no substantial differences to the service offered by a low-cost airline: no free food/beverage, little leg space, choice of seets only for extra payment, etc. However, the price I paid was at a low-cost level as well, so the value for money is OK.",yes,2017,0.02341367,0.24774016,0.72884613,-1
2017-06-13,Business Class,"  Gatwick to Alicante. My wife, my son (4) and me all flew BA Euro Club on our way to Alicante, for some reason when booking Club it was the same price as normal so it was a no brainer. My son has autism so we found the quite lounge amazing way to start our trip as he was very calm before. The staff at BA were very friendly before and on the plane which was a nice touch. Club Euro is a decent service if you pay a little extra, the lounge is a nice start then the extra service is nice on the plane, its a shame like all the other reviews point out the seats are the same it would be nice to have slightly more legroom",yes,2017,0.015815005,0.10515818,0.8790268,1
2017-06-10,Premium Economy,"  London to Hong Kong on a very new B777-300ER. I was upgraded to WT+ at the gate, owing to a full flight and probably being an Emerald with oneworld. I can now distil the difference in service/product with economy on the same route - with WT+ you will receive one amenity pack (eyeshades, socks, toothbrush), one welcome drink (""cava or water""), one glass for drinking with the first meal, a slightly wider seat (1 inch), minor extra recline (1 inch) and a little extra legroom, as well as a meaty dish for the main dinner (I am vegetarian so picked the vegetarian, which was the traditional BA carby pasta from WT, which was fine). I enjoyed the IFE, the crew were nice and the flight on time. I wouldn't pay a premium of more than £50 for the WT+ experience for this flight, or other WT+ routes. As a service, it's not really premium economy, in fact it's inferior to economy offered by 5 star carriers.",yes,2017,0.040486783,0.24579196,0.7137212,6
2017-06-07,Premium Economy,"  Washington to Sofia via London, flying World Traveller Plus premium economy to London and EuroTraveller economy on the short hop. Top quality service, whatever may have declined in economy class, premium economy is as good as ever with 38in leg-room and meals (really tasty in this instance) that can be ordered in advance. The cabin crew are still the BA strength creating a relaxed, congenial atmosphere in the cabin. Smooth connections at Terminal 5 with no waiting (either way) and Tribute Cornish Ale available on the long haul drinks menu, and service is a winner. (I'll admit the M&S food/drink service can be a bit time-consuming as far as handling the payments, but works OK otherwise.) British Airways continue to deliver a first-rate travel experience, and I'm sticking with them.",yes,2017,0.0037953046,0.052862324,0.9433424,6
2017-05-24,Economy Class,  Great flight from London to Kuala Lumpur on the Boeing 787-9. The crew were amazing and friendly and couldn't have done enough.

2017-05-19,Economy Class,"  London Heathrow to San Francisco return and pleasantly surprised with the service. All flights were on time and arrived ahead of schedule. Online check-in and baggage drop straightforward and without hassle. Food was excellent - particularly on outbound flight. My partner is vegetarian, and we both opted for vegetarian Hindu meal which proved to be delicious. Aircraft in good order and clean. Cabin crew - particularly on way out - were professional, attentive and friendly. Inflight entertainment choice was generally good, offering something for everyone. The only criticism is that seat-choice function is too expensive - even for economy class. British Airways are being very greedy in this respect, and their charges are way higher than other carriers. This was generally a positive experience.",yes,2017,0.02931499,0.12537761,0.84530735,-1
2017-05-17,Economy Class,"  On this route from Amsterdam to Tokyo Haneda via London Heathrow we had the expected service onboard. The first flight was slightly delayed, but our transfer time was more then 3 hours, so that didn't cost any problem. The cabin crew did their best to statisfy every passenger at the flight to HND. When we got our luggage we discovered that one of the suitcases was damaged. At HND Japan Airlines is the agent for British airways and as it cost time to explain everything. Their service was great. They filed a report to BA and when we are back from the journey we should contact BA to claim the damage. We did and within a few days we got a really extensive response and were compensated. Despite this damaged suitcase it was handled great. That's what made the difference to me.",yes,2017,0.035509747,0.17199136,0.7924989,-1
2017-05-15,Economy Class,"  I was pleasantly surprised with British Airways on both outbound and inbound flights from Orlando to Gatwick after reading the reviews. I would go as far as to say I would choose them over Virgin now unless there was a dramatic price difference. The crew both ways were friendly and really helpful, I have found Virgin crew to be a bit up themselves thinking they are a cut above the rest. Contrary to how Virgin crew are on an overnight flight (serve food, dim lights and keep out the way until hour before landing) BA crew still regularly came round making sure everyone was ok and if anyone wanted anything. We had nearly 3 hour delay leaving Orlando on G-VIIU, firstly due to inbound being a bit late due to an alligator closing the runway and finally a medical issue on board whilst positioned on runway to go. We returned to gate for paramedics, top up of fuel etc and departed at 20.20 versus 17.35. Throughout the crew were fantastic bringing drinks round and keeping us all informed. Whilst the interior of the leisure fleet of 777 is a bit on the tired side it was still comfortable I can recommend 24D as there is no PAX seat behind just a crew seat so no issues with being kneed in the back. For economy class leg room was good. Food was fairly decent for aircraft food. Only slight negative was the dated AVOD as it has small screens and not a great deal of choice compared to more modern systems.",yes,2017,0.025555523,0.1376323,0.8368122,-1
2017-05-14,Premium Economy,"  Flew Premium Economy from London to Toronto in a Boeing 787. Noisy aircraft - third time on this plane and not impressed. Seamless use of boarding pass on my smart phone (first time I have done this), as well as self-serve baggage drop. Flight good, cabin crew pleasant, food OK-ish, though nothing special. Back on a 777, more comfortable and quieter than 787, though still nowhere near A380 standards. Crew excellent, food unexpectedly good (the veggie lasagne was one of the best I've ever had), and the wine of a good quality. Luggage appeared promptly at both ends.

2017-05-13,Business Class,  Mexico City to Copenhagen via London. It appears inflight service has improved a bit in Club and the food is now edible and available. In flight entertainment reminds one of the VHS days. Number of films available is rather limited. Timing with food was great. Served quickly after take off and again late before arrival. Made time for a good rest. Configuration in club is not my favourite with reversed seats. Some crew choose to open the curtain every time the serve while other serve in front of you which will give you a better feeling of a private space Best thing about ba is that its cheap and you can have the Dorset crab for lunch at Fornum and Mason in terminal 5. Ba refuses to credit Qatar Airways avios even when Qatar Airways in writing has confirmed they should be credited. Showing one level on my online profile right now and anotheron my ticket.

2017-05-11,Business Class,  My wife and I flew British Airways from London Heathrow to Berlin Tegel in Club Europe. This was a free Avios upgrade. Having the middle seat blocked and a meal is the only onboard difference to economy. We paid for seat selection which I would not have been wiling to do if I had paid the silly prices charged for these short flights.

2017-05-08,Business Class,"  Berlin Tegel to London Heathrow in Club Europe business class. A weekend evening flight that was quite empty. I had selected a very cheap offer to upgrade to business class and for once it was worth the extra. Had checked in online so no contact with ground staff, and having arrived to berlin from Beijing with a tight connection I did not bother to use the Terraces lounge here. Knowing the lounge from previous visits, the staff are okay, a fair range of snacks and drinks, but lounge can become crowded and you have to walk outside the lounge to find toilets. Boarding was quick, only 5 out of 16 seats occupied in club cabin. Seats having limited seat pitch and are economy style with middle seat empty. Captain very informative, and they are BA's biggest asset for the details provided to customers. A hot chicken sandwich, cheese & biscuits and chocolate mousse was served - all to a good standard. Drinks of your choice from the bar and decent coffee to follow.

2017-05-06,Economy Class,"  These are words you may not read often, but I actually enjoy the British Airways flights from London City. The staff are friendly and, for now, they still feed you and offer extra drinks. After flying BA for several decades, I have decided to cut my losses on air miles and tier points for long haul because of the cost-cutting. But for short-haul, BA is my first choice out of City.",no,2017,0.01108464,0.08369938,0.9052159,-1
2017-05-05,Economy Class,"  Flew Manchester, UK to Billund, Denmark. Have flown with British Airways for over 10 years with work throughout Northern Europe. Compared to other airlines I've used they by far in my view, deliver better service all round. Staff are polite and friendly. Food is always tasty. Easy check in system at the airport. Efficient and very good value for money all round.",yes,2017,0.0027089634,0.036920432,0.96037066,6
2017-05-04,First Class,"  Return trip for me and my wife using Avios flying from London Heathrow to Miami. Staff were very friendly and professional on both sectors. Flights on time. Food and drink choices/quality were decent, but not on a par with some other carriers. It's clear BA's cost cutting affects all cabins. On the outbound leg my choice of main course was unavailable as they had already been given to other passengers. Having said that, I could have ordered in advance via the web site. On the return leg, it's worth noting that access to/from the lounge is via a single elevator and very time consuming. So it was a nice touch that one of the ground staff escorted me and my wife (we are both gold card holders) from the lounge and put us on the aircraft first as the boarding gate was chaotic due to it being a holiday weekend. Overall, very enjoyable flights, but not any better than some airlines' business class.",no,2017,0.021200271,0.12534042,0.8534593,-1
2017-05-04,Economy Class,"  Flew Nice to London with British Airways in economy. Won't bother again. Moving most of my travel to KLM/LH now where I can at least get a complimentary G&T. BA nice flight had minimal legroom, only 1 lavatory at the back (with aisle blocked however by crew selling buy on board). So low cost. So over them.",no,2017,0.03737942,0.19733094,0.76528966,0
2017-05-01,Economy Class,"  Zürich to London Heathrow. As part of a 12-days-trip almost around the world my first leg from Zürich to London was on British Airways. It turned out to be quite a pleasant and enjoyable experience. Thanks to early online-check-in I managed to secure a bulkhead aisle-seat. I would have preferred a window-seat though. Boarding started on time and there was a very friendly purser welcoming the passengers. After I settled down I approached her with my request. She said that the flight was completely full but promised to do her best. After less than five minutes she returned to me and offered me a seat at the window but emphasized that my actual seat had much more legroom. So I stayed. The rest of the crew seemed to be cheerful and happy too. Special requests by other passengers were dealt with professionalism. I brought my own snack and water along which was a wise thing to do as the catering-service was slow. The new procedure takes too much time and let passengers disappointed as their choice is running out quickly. BA should reinstall the old system again. The cabin was spacious but the aircraft showed its age. The flight took off with a delay of 20 minutes but was a the gate at Terminal 5 15 minutes before scheduled arrival time.

2017-04-30,Economy Class,"  Flew British Airways from London Gatwick to Orlando. Contrary to a lot of the other reviews I found the aircraft and staff on board to be fine. Sat in 24 d on G-VIIO seat was comfortable and big enough with a decent amount of recline. I agree the IFE is not to the standard of other airlines but it was watchable and had a fairly decent amount of content on it. The staff were all friendly, attentive and helpful so no problems there.

2017-04-27,Business Class,"  Pisa to London Gatwick. Started return flight in the shared lounge. All very pleasant and not busy for once. Walked the tarmac to the plane as BA are too mean to pay for a skybridge anymore. Plane fairly new and a lot better than the old crate we flew out in. Took off on time. We had the front row of the business class. For once I had the meal - as it looked nice. It was a salmon salad - and I have to say it was very good indeed. My wife had a hot cheese sandwich which she said was ok. Champagne was served from the bottle, it was nice. We landed on time and closer to the terminal. Not bad for BA for once.",no,2017,0.0050525335,0.034643326,0.96030414,-1

Reading instructions we were approached and offered help by a BA staff member. Check in cheerfully done. BA airport staff faultless. Seats, food and entertainment good, drinks plentiful, staff attentive and friendly. Return trip, flight crew greeted us with smiles and showed us to our seats. Club seats with headphones, eye masks, socks, blankets etc. Drinks service started straight away and available all flight.  Dinner and breakfast terrific. Staff attentive and friendly all flight. All in all both flights were on clean aircraft with friendly attentive crew. We couldn't fault our flights however I have sympathy for those who have troubles.

2017-04-23,Premium Economy,"  World Traveler Plus from Heathrow to SFO. The only whinge we had with the experience is that the new entertainment system had to be re-booted.  Boarding was pretty much average, with no zone boarding for economy, just everybody get on.  First time in Premium Economy, and we loved it. Where BA shined was post-flight. I did the unforgivable and walked off with the wrong checked bag.  Discovered it 3 hours drive later. Got contacted by staff at BA luggage, and in spite of the mess being entirely my fault, immediately volunteered to FedEx overnight my bag to me.  Also, having just come from a cruise on a line famed for its food, the food stood up surprisingly well compared to Oceania's.",yes,2017,0.038157787,0.17235108,0.7894912,-1
2017-04-19,Economy Class,"  Stavanger to Las Vegas via London Heathrow. This is a salute to the fantastic staff at Terminal 3 helping my group out when everything seemed lost, because of American Airlines terrible customer service. The trip was originally meant to be a codeshare where we flew with BA booking under AA flights from LHR to LAS via JFK. The trip took place on April 3rd 2017 We risked being stranded with 16 out of 19 travelers at LHR, because of AA somehow ""magically"" losing our itineraries and not interested at all in helping, rather blaming everyone else. The BA service personnel spent hours trying to solve it, and  decided to take matters in their own hands. They got us 16 travelers on their direct flight from LHR to LAS the day after, arranging for accommodation, transport to/from the airport and Dinner / Breakfast, even though AA was mainly responsible for our journey. The service on-board was to expect from a economy flight of that duration. Seats was good, food all right, complimentary drinks and very welcome. The IFE was great, the screens was a little small compared to other newer aircraft's for this type of long haul, but no particular issues.",yes,2017,0.09985937,0.29031637,0.60982424,-1
2017-04-16,Business Class,"  A business class sale convinced me to give it a try on a trip home from Sofia to Boston. I have to say that my wife, daughter and I were completely pleased, somewhat surprisingly so. Quick efficient checkin at the business class counter in Sofia. Decent contract lounge. Excellent service and food onboard both the Club Europe flight to London and Club World flight to Boston. Terrific flight attendants, and much better food than I am used to on United, LH or Austrian. I have a gluten allergy and need to order special meals. All three gluten free meals on this trip were among the best I have had. All three included flavorful sauces, which is something LH always omits from its special meals. The Galleries lounge in the B satellite terminal was excellent. Not as much food on offer as in the LH and OS lounges, or even the new UA lounge at Heathrow T2, but it was quiet and comfortable. And we really liked the quirky Club World business cabin. The middle section is great for couples, every seat has a storage drawer and the entertainment system was solid. There were four toilets for business class. My only complaint: the outrageous policy that required me to pay to reserve seats together in business class. As the fight was not full, I probably could have gotten seats together at checkin, but I did not want to take the risk, and BA got additional revenue, which is obviously why they do it.",yes,2017,0.01997718,0.09984852,0.8801742,-1
2017-04-15,Business Class,"  An excellent experience on a roundtrip trip from Hong Kong to Copenhagen through London. Despite being in economy class, the flight attendants were attentive and also proactive (serving our needs before we even needed to ask). They were friendly and made us feel completely at home. The on-board entertainment selection was very extensive, with high-quality options (English and international movies of high caliber) and the screen interface was modern and easy to use. The seats on the flight from HKG-LHR on the Boeing 777-300ER were new, and much more comfortable than the average older seat. The pilot was incredibly descriptive of the flight path we were taking, and kept us up to date in terms of turbulence, arrival time, weather without being overbearing or overly disruptive. With regards to the pre-boarding/ground service, one of the check-in representatives went out of her way accommodating my boyfriend and I so that we could sit together and have a window seat (both of which were not available at check-in due to the fact that we had bought our tickets separately and had not selected seats beforehand). We really appreciated her willingness to look at what she could do to make our trip more pleasant. This was not my first time flying with British Airways, but it had been a long time since I last boarded a long-haul flight with them, and the trip exceeded my expectations. British Airways in my opinion is not the outdated carrier that many deem it to be. ",yes,2017,0.004218624,0.043762024,0.95201933,4
2017-03-26,Premium Economy,"  London to Nairobi return in February, during the industrial action. We found the crew to be friendly and attentive. The food was ok, I had the spicy chicken which I didn't much care for, it was rather unusually badly prepared, with great hunks of chicken and vegetables, just not as nice as the beef my husband was eating. On the return flight, we were 2 flight attendants down due to the strike, but they were excellent and more than made up for the missing staff. I know that there has been a lot of gripes about BA downgrading its services, but these flights were really good, and that there were lots of drinks runs during the sleep time. Didn't much care for the cereal bars but the 2 cups of tea made up for that! ",yes,2017,0.08894349,0.2225823,0.68847424,5
2017-03-17,Economy Class,"  Flew British Airways from Beijing - London Heathrow, Emerald member so a one minute check-in with a dedicated counter was appreciated. The BGS Lounge which BA uses was a welcome surprise, owing to the fact that there are many Japanese food options at that time (JAL also shares the lounge). Business section almost the same as First, albeit more people. Boarding seamless. Here is where the ""value"" ends. Two meals for 11 hour flight, but if requesting snacks in between you are directed to a copy of Highlife where there is a ""sweet treat"" menu, with sugar family items priced around £2-3 each. I declined that, and stayed hungry. The meals served were carb-rich pasta (tasteless) and a rice meal (dry, tasteless). I have minimal needs, but I do know BA has cut back so much now that it really is drink + meal + drink + meal on trans-con flights. Crew were friendly enough. Free exit-row seats for friend and I (Emerald benefit).",no,2017,0.034663714,0.3330842,0.6322521,-1
2017-03-16,Business Class,"  San Diego to London, an excellent flight with really good Club World service from crew.

2017-03-13,Business Class,"  Amsterdam to Gatwick was the usual short haul commuter flight, no difference in seating apart from the empty seat in the middle of three seats, no apparent additional leg room compared to economy class. Onward flight to St Lucia, paid for advanced seating allocation as did not want to travel facing the back of the aircraft. Tired, worn interior and the food reflected this too. Outbound crew were helpful and energetic, keen to assist where possible and were prompt to attend when the call button was used. Inbound flight was the same tired interior, unappealing menu and indifferent service. The only redeeming event was that my reading glasses and pen, left on board on the outbound flight were returned to me 5 days later when I travelled home. 10/10 to British Airways staff in St Lucia for managing this so well. I hope that BA will be renewing its fleet soon, it will not be my first choice of carrier for long haul travel until some investment has been made.",no,2017,0.07021751,0.26644835,0.66333413,1
2017-03-04,Business Class,"  Overnight flight from St Lucia to Gatwick. Efficient check in. Lounge at St Lucia was pretty dire, some snacks provided which were ok. Plane on time. Club world middle seats which were a good option for us. The food options on this flight were not of the usual standard I would expect of business class. The starter of melon and cucumber was poor. The chicken main was overcooked and lacked any flavor. Drinks were good. Some options missing as not loaded but quality generally good. FA's were in the main good but some better than others. I was well looked after. However, the FA attending to my wife lacked experience and it showed. Overall a good flight. On the subject of baggage, it would seem that few of us with priority tagged baggage received their bags quickly (mine were almost last!).",yes,2017,0.050227843,0.20743546,0.7423367,1
2017-03-04,Business Class,"  Cape Town to London Heathrow in an old but well kept Boeing 747. Full flight. Flight left and arrived on time. What made this flight so outstanding was the crew.

The plane was spotless, comfortable and well presented. The staff were impeccable, polite and helpful - in my view some of the best. The only thing I would ask is that they review the food. They have certainly cut their costs in particular for breakfast before landing and that was insubstantial. Overall they continue to impress.",yes,2017,0.02137339,0.083232835,0.8953938,6
2017-02-26,Business Class,"  London Heathrow to Chicago O'Hare and my experience was wonderful. There were a few problems checking in at Terminal 5 (there was an issue with some of the luggage belts at check-in running slow - never mind these things happen). We were given information about what was happening and staff were doing their best. Fast-track security was fast. Made my way to the lounge in South Terminal which was busy but I was able to find a quiet spot. Lots of food and drinks on offer but I stuck to water as I knew would be eating on the plane. Had to go to a gate in B terminal - this was my first time at Terminal 5 so asked how to get to the gate, very easy instructions given and transportation via the transit train. Boarding was easy although I didn't use the priority boarding service (my bad missing the announcement). I paid extra so I could pre-book my seat (63J) on the upper deck and really glad I did. Our cabin crew were wonderful, so attentive and polite and nothing seemed any bother for them. The food was good for airplane food and the pink champagne was very nice! I managed to get a couple of hours sleep which is very unusual for me. There's lots of room and the upper deck is limited to a maximum of 20 passengers so it feels very private. The window seats have lots of storage but unless you are in 62 or 64 A/K you have to climb over your neighbour's foot stool/legs to get in and out of your seat. 63J is an aisle seat so less private but lots of room as it's by an exit door (ideal for anybody over 6ft). There is a long not too high drawer to place items (I put a pair of knee-length leather boots in there without any issue and there was room for more) and there's the overhead lockers. I couldn't fault my trip out and I am hoping my return trip is just as enjoyable.",yes,2017,0.01679973,0.08932812,0.8938722,5
2017-02-21,Economy Class,"  Gatwick to Cape Town. This journey was a very pleasant surprise. I didn't expect great service and was not disappointed. I didn't expect great food or wine and was not disappointed. I didn't expect a comfortable economy seat and was pleasantly surprised. This was an older 777 with a 3-3-3 configuration (31"" seat pitch) in economy and comfortable seats. I flew to South Africa this time last year with Virgin on their new B787 and it was a nightmare. The comfort of seat on a long haul is far more important to me that anything else and this was a far more pleasant experience than I had expected.",yes,2017,0.017527971,0.07472787,0.90774417,1

2017-02-16,Business Class," London to Hong Kong with British Airways. The flight is good as I booked the best business seat and it is imperative if flying BA to get this best seat 16K, other seats are below standard for long haul business. Yet a similar seat on an A380 is better. Service is good and food is adequate. I fly this route many times on BA rather than CX: CX is better but BA better priced, and that is, if you get the best seat. 7 points for B777 and 8 for A380.",yes,2017,0.01481207,0.1240721,0.8611158,0

2017-02-01,Economy Class,"  Gatwick to Mauritius return. Absolutely fine from online check in, baggage drop at Gatwick to collecting baggage in Mauritius. Allocated seats together (2 passengers) given at online check in, with no need to change these. Pleasant and courteous staff member at baggage drop. Boarding by cabin class and row numbers and ran pretty smoothly. Boeing 777 about 16 years old, but still in presentable condition. I'm 1.8 m. tall and medium build and I found the seat pretty comfortable for a 12-hour flight in economy - at least this aircraft type is still 9 abreast despite the slightly dated look of the cabin. Not the largest seat screen I've experienced but fine, and there was a reasonable selection of movies, tv and music. Drinks service followed by hot meal (roast chicken in sauce or veggie option). We ate in the terminal before departing just in case the food offering was going to be dire, but despite the reduction in food given on the tray we couldn't really fault what was provided. Lights out after dinner until about an hour before landing when a hot breakfast was served. Cabin crew friendly and efficient service, with water service through the night, plus option to get drinks from the galley. Landed on time. Spent ages in the queue at immigration, luggage waiting for us and then taxi to hotel. We got there safely, on time and in reasonable comfort. Return flight a week later pretty much the same as outbound.",yes,2017,0.015945971,0.1671172,0.81693685,1
2017-01-27,First Class,"  London Heathrow to Philadelphia return. Very good experience both flights. Mature crew outbound with longer waits for drinks and meal service, very energetic younger crew on return, where everything happened quickly and efficiently. Both crews friendly and had control of the cabin, which made for a relaxed atmosphere. Food noticeably better than of late - I hope this will continue. On return my original onward flight cancelled due to fog, but rebooking had been done by the time I checked in in PHL and I had a text message also to that effect. Concorde Room fine both ways though it is starting to look a little frayed, but still acceptable even if the food and beverage staff do not always smile very much. All in all good solid enjoyable flights. I would add that this review applies to my most recent experience as others have not been so positive.",yes,2017,0.013590737,0.07191691,0.9144923,-1

I had a middle seat, 7E, but it turned out fine, but definitely narrower than the seats on other airlines business class. I did not need to go over anybody to get in and out, however the other middle seats might not have been as easy. Staff on the London to San Jose flight was good but not warm or personal.

2017-01-15,Business Class,  Houston to London Heathrow in Business Class. The service from the cabin crew was less attentive and organised than the outbound flight. British Airways used a Boeing 777 plane rather than the 747 used on the outward journey. This meant there was no upper deck seating. The seats are comfortable and convert to flat beds. Both journeys provided a welcome drink and 3 course menu. I found I was still hungry after the meal so made use of the snacks available at the bar. I used the arrivals lounge at LHR which was great to have a shower and some breakfast.,yes,2017,0.07118903,0.32574525,0.6030657,-1

The check-in queues in Amman were annoying but, other than that, this London-Amman-London trip reminded me of how flying used to be.",yes,2017,0.033585172,0.11019885,0.85621595,0
2017-01-11,Economy Class,"  London Heathrow to Rome return, outbound with an A320 and inbound a Boeing 767. Outbound flight was delayed due to engine problem just before taking off with consequent 5 hours delays. BA did look after us well though. Replacement aircraft found (another A320) and we safely arrived to destination. Cabin crew was very helpful and polite. Return on an old but still good looking B767 (I believe they will be phased out in 2017) which has plenty of legroom and space in economy, although the overhead bins are not too spacious (I guess that is the way they used to be). We departed and landed on time. Overall a good experience despite the outbound delay but I prefer airlines that are able to make safety calls to those that would not!

Outbound was upgraded a couple of months ago from World Traveller Plus (worth the money for a decent night's sleep). Fast check in and fast track security at Pearson meant I was in the lounge within 15 mins. Excellent lounge supper service with a choice of a roast or noodles in soup. The lounge is well managed and maintained with friendly staff and a well stocked bar. On time boarding but a delayed departure due to loading baggage. A glass of champagne, with a top up, before departure. I always find boarding in Club World disjointed and fragmented as crew from World Traveler assist making the pre departure service erratic. A fast drinks service and supper were served with lights out. A well timed late breakfast meant a decent 5 hours sleep on this leg and my food choices were actually available. Priority bags beat me to the baggage belt. The return leg was enhanced due to being upgraded 24 hours before departure. (clearly oversold for such early action but welcome as a BA Silver member). The flight was one of my best business class flights and reminded me of the old BA I knew and loved. Fast bar service done by tray and not by cart, an excellent meal of roast chicken, with a delicious caramel desert (plated too) and some decent wines. The only reduction in service spotted this time was the wine list was down to two reds, two whites and no Rose. That said, the wines were very good. The cabin crew excelled throughout with the two crew professional, friendly and delivering excellent customer service promptly when asked. Afternoon tea is a now a bit of let down with the scones dropped. An early landing, and prompt bags on the belt completed a stellar trip back home. If only BA could deliver this standard consistently with an improved product and friendly crew and sort out the flawed and outdated seat layout, then there is a chance BA could return to it's former glory",yes,2017,0.016758284,0.12749729,0.8557445,2
2016-12-27,First Class,"  Having read so many negative reviews on this site regarding British Airways and their First Class product I was somewhat concerned as to what the experience would be like on our First Class flight from LHR-SAN on BA273 on their B747-400, I needn't have worried, this flight was excellent on all aspects. Our domestic connecting flight from MAN-LHR was delayed by 2 hours due to fog at LHR, the Captain  came into the Gate area and explained the reasons of the delay and invited questions from any concerned passengers about their connecting flights in LHR. Luckily we had planned 4 hours into our itinerary so the delay caused us no problems, passengers with tight connections at LHR were offered alternative connection options. The Concorde Lounge in LHR T5 BA First Class passengers was superb with professional and courteous staff, we had booked a Cabana and Spa Treatments, both were superb and highly recommended, plan time into your itinerary to enjoy these to the full. The lounge offers A la Carte Dining and the food was excellentpromptly, Champagne and great wines were also available. Onboard the BA747 in the First Cabin we had seats 2A & 2K, these offered great comfort for the 11 hour flight, the seats were made into a bed by the cabin crew when you requested it, I got 6 hours sleep, good quality quilts and pillows helped this. Seats 1A or 1K may have been slightly better for a couple travelling together as they are closer together than 2A 2K, but this is not a negative issue. The meal service was excellent, dine when you want, excellent choice of aperitifs, wines and champagne. The young Cabin Crew offered excellent attentive service in a very professional manner throughout the 11 hour flight. First Class seats offer good privacy, probably centre seats 4EF and 5EF offer the least privacy and therefore I would avoid these where possible. BA First is in a league of it's own and miles ahead of Club, both in the Air and on the Ground! Well done BA, this really was a First Class experience in every meaning of the words.",yes,2016,0.028731156,0.16313767,0.8081312,-1
2016-12-27,Economy Class,"Flew London Gatwick to Tampa with British Airways. Gatwick is a modern airport, but check-in was slow as was security. In the departure hall plenty of places to eat and shop. Gate shown about an hour before departure. Waited for 30-45 mins at gate as plane was delayed by about 20 minutes. Boarding took a very long time as it was a full flight. Once on board the aircraft we departed quickly.The seats was pretty old but just about comfortable enough. Once in the air immigration cards are handed out followed by a drink service, but no pretzels like BA used to do. About 2 hours after take off food was served. (chicken curry or vegetable lasagna). Lunch was quite nice, but small. After lunch duty free was sold. Four hours into the flight the cabin lights were turned off. The IFE was OK, there were lots of movies and tv shows, but not many games. Also the screen went fuzzy when the moving map was on. Screen was small but touch screen still worked. Between meals there were snacks available, but they had to be paid for (there used to be a free snack box). Drinks were also avaliable and free between meals. An hour before a sandwich, kitkat and a drink were served, the size was not adequate, but tasted nice. After the service was cleared plane stared the long descent into Tampa airport. Once we landed it was a long walk to immigration, however the queue was short. Overall the flight was not bad. Not much food, but crew were helpful and attentive.",yes,2016,0.042953886,0.32740352,0.6296426,1

2016-12-22,Premium Economy,"  This was a much better flight than our outward LHR-BKK with British Airways. The staff were on the ball, worked hard and always around. A nice plane, good IFE with wide modern screen. Seats were fine although storage lacking compared to A380. Food still a letdown . Chicken served in kebabs but far too sweet and soggy. White wine good red poor. Breakfast scrambled eggs and steak! Spoilt by having a greasy liquid in the bottom of tray rendering pretty well inedible.

2016-12-14,Business Class,London Heathrow to Hong Kong. We have not flown long haul with British Airwaves for many years. This flight was a revelation. Staff attentive and good.

2016-12-09,Premium Economy,"  IAD-LHR return in World Traveller Plus. Quite enjoyable flights both ways with first-rate leg-room (38in in WTP vs 31in in regular WT remains a strong positive point with me), some of the best airline cuisine I've had in recent years, an excellent pre-meal drinks service including Tribute Cornish ale, on-time departure/arrival and the attentive, courteous cabin-crew service I've received through the years from British Airways. (Two tiny flyspecks though - no more newspapers on boarding and no nibbles with the drinks service, but nowhere nearly enough to ruin the overall trip.) This remains my favourite way of flying between the USA and Europe. I am a regular Skytrax reader and note the numerous negative reviews BA's regular tourist-class service has latterly received in this forum (haven't flown it myself in a couple of years though), but on this and other recent showings BA's World Traveller Plus premium economy remains as good as ever.

2016-12-04,Business Class,"Good service flying from London to Madrid, attentive crew and acceptable breakfast on outbound leg and meal on return leg. Outbound leg the crew were pleasant and efficient. On the return leg the crew were one of the most attentive and approachable I have met on a BA flight in quite some time. Food for a shorthaul flight was very good and drinks including champagne regularly offered. The only gripe I have is that unless you are a One World Emerald card holder you can't select your seat at the time of booking unless you pay £22 per person per sector. I think it's a British Airways thing. Even the LCCs let you book your seat for a reasonable cost. Paying business class prices I expect to get seat selection as a standard regardless of my status. I think this policy is misguided and I will take this into consideration in booking future flights.",yes,2016,0.042159334,0.2102524,0.7475883,2
2016-11-29,First Class,"Check-in at Singapore Airport is carried out in a separate area away from the desks and it was done quickly, efficiently and enables you to bypass the queue to enter the terminal. Boarding was chaotic. After announcing families with children, first and club passengers, and cardholders, the staff simply let everybody head towards the entrance. As before, the cabin crew were professional, helpful and enthusiastic. Dinner was served quite soon after takeoff because it was a late evening flight. It seems a shame that in its desire to cut costs, British Airways uses tablecloths and napkins which seem a little too thin and the cutlery is slightly too small. Nevertheless, the food was tasty and cooked properly and there was a good selection of wine and spirits. After a couple of glasses of port they made my bed and I slept soundly for several hours. The seat is equipped with two USB ports but these put out such little power by iPhone took a long time to charge and they could not handle an iPad. We landed at Heathrow on time and reached Terminal 5 within a matter of minutes. One of British Airways’ greatest assets is its cabin crew who, in my experience, are considerably better than their rivals. What the airline needs to do is to stop attempting to save money and start giving its premium class passengers those little extras that they have become accustomed to on other airlines. It might have been a one-off but it also needs to ensure that boarding is carried out properly.",yes,2016,0.060832556,0.23814318,0.7010243,5
2016-11-29,Economy Class,"  New York JFK to London. Pleasantly surprised to have experienced a nice flight on BA. Although the aircraft was relatively old, the seats were comfortable with a generous seat width and pitch. I had a rude shock when I was told I had to be seated in the middle seat of the middle row but it turned out alright. The slack with BA is that we have to purchase a seat if we wanted a specific seat. It is their way of ancillary income. The IFE can be improved as they have very limited offerings. Cabin crew were extremely friendly and attentive. They were tested when we had an ill passenger upon taxiing for departure. They showed compassion and were professional in their services.

2016-11-29,Economy Class,"  London Heathrow to Belfast City. A really good flight, left on time, crew smiled and looked like they were having fun. A full cooked British breakfast which was served with great efficiency and was hot. Interactions with passengers positive. Landed on time and as had no luggage we were in the long queue for rental car in no time at all. Flight back was not as good as was delayed due to fog earlier in the day, check in was surly but on board crew still fine. On both flights the crews paid extra attention to children and I liked how they delivered child lifejackets to the bins above kids for each child passenger. Fare was cheap too, the only disappointment being that they don't have business class on domestic flights so we couldn't treat ourselves to a bit of luxury",yes,2016,0.046629313,0.1515015,0.80186915,5

The premium economy seats on the upper deck were clean and comfortable and the food served was well above average.

The lounge at Marrakesh is a joke with only a few seats and very limited choice of drinks - 2 miniature bottles of wine between approx 20 passengers. However the flight itself was good with nice meal and champagne. The cabin service manager was great going around offering drinks frequently for a 3 hour flight this was brilliant.

We were in an older 777-200, so the seats weren't very comfortable due to the material and the entertainment screen was small. We departed late as they had to unload bags, they also had to reset the entertainment system. In the air we were offered beverages. Later in the flight, the meal service. There was chicken curry (I had it - it was nice but the rice was a bit dry) and a pink-looking coleslaw as a side salad. The dessert was a butterscotch/chocolate mousse, which was good. The other alternative was a pasta. I watched some films - there was a good range - and I like how the BBC News is up to date so I could catch up with the current affairs. The crew were not overly friendly, but kept servicing us with extra drinks. I had a nap, and then we were served a small landing snack. The much rumoured Mars Bar is actually true, as well as some Belgian chocolate cookies and other small snacks.

I was welcomed to the First Class cabin by an enthusiastic cabin crew. There was a slight delay on taking off which was made easier with a second glass of champagne. Throughout the flight and cabin crew achieved the perfect balance of being friendly, helpful and interested as well as anticipating what I needed. The food was to a high standard and my wine glass was kept topped up. After dinner, the crew member assigned to me, a mirthful Frenchman, made my bed and I had six hours sleep to wake up to breakfast consisting of fruit followed by a full English.

Departed on time crew provided a snack and drink on the 1 hour flight. Return check in again quick although the security system at BHD is slow very slow. Used the Executive lounge which is okay with a supply of snacks and drinks, it's also adjacent to the gate used by BA is pretty handy. Departed on time, seat 16B on another clean A320, crew served a hot breakfast on this flight which was pretty good for a domestic flight.

The seat were comfortable and spacious even when the seat in front was fully reclined on the over night flight you still had space and room.

Bed for sleeping comfortable but too narrow. Power outlets wouldn't work with my iPhone or iPad. Table for dinner wouldn't extend properly and reading light fell out of its socket - on a new aircraft? We had a lovely flight all in redeeming Avios for occasion.

It therefore came as a pleasant surprise that this seems to have changed. The stewardesses were very friendly and attentive. The aircraft was a Boeing 787 with a seat configuration of 3+3+3 which was good. In-flight entertainment was very good and it worked. Boarding at Seoul Incheon airport was surprisingly quick.

Let me begin by saying that BA crews are tremendous. They are friendly, approachable, professional, amiable and affable. The flight deck did a great job in getting us there safely and they were informative without being over bearing with their announcements. The service on board was very good, the food was plentiful and quite tasty. The inflight entertainment was excellent. Loads of choices and great quality. All in all a great experience.

The seat was comfortable with ample legroom, the food was excellent for airline food and both ground staff and flight crew were friendly and efficient. The flight was quiet and smooth, on time and made up time on the flight. The only downside was that the inflight entertainment stopped working after one hour, despite the crews efforts it could not be restored for the remainder of the flight. We did note one steward enter the premium economy cabin with a list and upgraded about 15 people into business, the rest of us went without for 8 hours. It worked fine on the return journey and I guess it's just one of those things, just annoyed me that a certain selected few were upgraded and the rest ignored.",yes,2016,0.106024645,0.2675899,0.62638545,-1

The flight was smooth, and the information from the flight deck kept us up to date on the progress of the flight. The cabin crew even managed to find the last miniature of single-malt scotch for me (good job, guys). Transit through Heathrow was hassle-free, and the flight to Edinburgh was on time, this time on an Airbus 319. Again, the service was on time, the cabin crew efficient, the flight smooth, and the bags came out at Edinburgh with no hassle. The return flight was equally good: prompt departure from Edinburgh, easy transfer at Heathrow, and on-time departure to Kuwait. This time, an un-refurbished 747, with the small seat-back screen, so I did not bother using the entertainment system. The evening meal was the dreaded ""chicken or pasta"" (come on, BA, can't we have a change) but edible and tasty, and the cabin crew were professional and unobtrusive, passing through the cabin regularly with juice and water on this overnight flight. Overall, the flight was up to the usual standards I expect from BA: I was safe, comfortable, adequately fed and watered, and all four journeys were on time and hassle-free, with a professional set of cabin crew and clean, tidy and well-maintained aircraft. Well done, BA.",yes,2016,0.013610071,0.10385321,0.88253677,5
2016-10-29,Economy Class,"  British Airways was the cheapest airline when I booked this flight from Edinburgh to Gatwick, cheaper than Easyjet. Great service, ok snack food. Professional all round. Captain spoke with me personally. Plane was on time and no issues. Best value flight from a great little airport.",yes,2016,0.0021327217,0.025236214,0.97263104,0
2016-10-15,Economy Class,"Travelling with British Airways is always a good experience, took a short break to Majorca out on 10/10 returning 14/10 from LHR T5. Flew out on G-EUYY A320 and back on G-EUXF A321 both excellent flights, the crew were very smart and welcoming and the aircraft clean and comfortable. Enjoyed the lunch and bar service going out and refreshments and bar service on return. Noting other reviews its a shame people board flights hungry as their are many outlets at the airports prior to boarding, even major retailers do good ""meal deals"". The crew make the difference ensuring a safe comfortable flight.",yes,2016,0.0052039097,0.050072026,0.944724,-1
2016-10-05,Economy Class,  Flew London Heathrow to Lisbon with British Airways. The plane was slightly delayed but the captain explained why and we recovered the delay on the way. I believe communication to be important and appreciate the gesture. The crew were extremely nice and the snack we were given was just fine for such a short flight. I am only sorry we had to take a bus in Lisbon to get to the terminal.,yes,2016,0.07181469,0.26588508,0.6623002,-1
2016-10-03,Economy Class,"  We frequently use British Airways morning flight from Boston to London, and will again, but the reduction in the quality of food served in economy is startling. The English Breakfast choice was a pleasant surprise until this last flight, on which the reduction of portion size and quality was noticeable. The pre landing snack had always been a decent chicken salad sandwich, but on this flight, it was a cookie - maybe two; I forget. The cabin crew was efficient and friendly, and the AVOD was excellent, much improved from the older 747's, which we have had on the route. Beware, however, Fast Track security at Heathrow, which twice in the last six months, has been glacial, no better than regular lines.",yes,2016,0.034218293,0.19076109,0.77502066,-1
2016-10-01,Economy Class,"London Heathrow to Bergen. Took off and landed on time. Sandwich on the outbound flight was good with plenty of drinks on this short flight.

2016-09-30,First Class,  Singapore to London Heathrow with British Airways. The was our first experience on BA's A380 and it was very comfortable and relaxing. We usually fly Etihad from Australia to LHR but this time decided to try BA. The boarding at Singapore was efficient friendly and on time. As this was a late evening flight (2320) we just wanted to get settled and into bed as soon as possible. We made this point to the crew and they were fantastic in making this happen as soon as they were permitted to set up the beds. The config of First Class in BA is 1-2-1 with 2 aisles. This is not as good as the Etihad First which has a central aisle with individual cabins (called apartments) of the aisle. Never the less the seats were fine for flat bed sleeping if a little narrow. The staff were very professional and did not bother us until breakfast time. Breakfast was just ok with limited options but this was ok for us. The A380 is clearly the benchmark in long haul First Class flight and on this occasion BA provided a high quality service.,yes,2016,0.05744449,0.27959225,0.6629633,0
2016-09-29,First Class," We flew Melbourne to Singapore via Sydney on 1 September with British Airways. Our preferred airline is Etihad but we decided to try BA as we secured a very competitive First fare. I have never flown BA before but have heard not so good reports, so was a bit apprehensive. We were delighted with the service from Qantas (BA flys out of SYD) in Melbourne in booking our bags through to Singapore. The boarding in SYD was very smooth and we were warmly welcomed by the very professional cabin crew. The 777 First is a 1-2-1 configuration and we had the centre seats with the drop down privacy screen. Departure (1500) was on time and the 9 hour flight up to Singapore was very smooth. Cabin staff were very helpful and attentive. The was ample room to stretch out although we did not makeup the sleeping option as we were connecting in Singapore to go on to LHR. The food was lovely as was the choice of wine and drinks. In summary, we were delighted with the service and flight.",yes,2016,0.0049622776,0.034229305,0.96080846,-1
2016-09-29,Business Class,"Early morning flight to Amsterdam from London. A complicated schedule cause a little stir at check-in but check-in were woderful this morning and did their at most to assist. Straight to the plane which was an older B-767 with a 2-2-2 configuration in business class. Crew professional and efficient, choice between cold meet or full english for breakfast. Full served and cabin cleared in the 50 minutes the flight lasted. Despite a delay out of London we were down on time in Amsterdam. The cabin was crying out for a refurbishment but otherwise a good flight.",yes,2016,0.018355748,0.230353,0.7512913,-1
2016-09-25,Economy Class,Flew British Airways from London Heathrow to Johannesburg. We enjoyed the flight very much on the A380. We chose two seats together and it was comfortable.

2016-09-21,Business Class,"One way, London Heathrow to Amsterdam with British Airways. Flight itself was good. Food tasty and staff friendly. This is a short flight and the flight attendants have a lot to do in a little amount of time, so they can be forgiven for being seemingly hasty. The only complaint is the incredibly crowded lounge. Lockers in the lounge would be a great improvement, especially for solo travelers.",yes,2016,0.07504328,0.21516776,0.7097889,-1
2016-09-20,Business Class,"  BA club Europe, London Heathrow - Istanbul - London Heathrow over a weekend, check in at T5 quick as was priority security used the galleries South lounge which while very busy was okay with a few breakfast food options away from the main terminal. Boarding organised on to a pretty old 767 however seat 5A clean and comfortable, departed a little late but caught up the time with on time arrival. Crew very good, friendly and chatty, one of BA's assets, food served was also nice lots of drink runs on the 3hr 45min flight. Check in on the return again quick as was the priority security lane otherwise Istanbul Ataturk airport is not my favourite its crowded & dirty, the lounge used by BA is one of the worst! Not worth the trouble of finding. Boarding through gate 209 organised seat 3A old but clean and comfortable 767, departed about 1 hour late good food & service from a nice crew, arriving LHR on time although the flight arrived on to the furthest possible gate and immigration (Not BA's fault) took so long with huge queue which meant over 1 hour getting landside. Good service. Will continue to use British Airways if the price is right.",yes,2016,0.102186896,0.28794205,0.60987103,2
2016-09-17,Economy Class,"London Heathrow to Cape Town. Check in at Heathrow T3 very efficient. Used my card to access the BA Lounge at T3 which is pretty average, although enjoyed a good supper with very good claret so did not need to eat on plane. Boarding a bit of a mess at remote gate 35 where both the PA and aircon were not working, but nonetheless everyone seemed to be seated before the inevitable missing passenger/bag offload, which caused a 30min push back delay. Service seemed efficient on board (although I did not eat dinner) and we had a friendly young crew member on our aisle. Managed to get some rest and with enjoyed breakfast before landing at CPT, 30 mins late. All in all, reasonable value for money. The usual hopeless British Airways IFE which needs constant re-sets and is from the age of the ark.",yes,2016,0.053076588,0.22287902,0.7240444,-1

Incoming plane late for about 30 minutes, boarding for 20 minutes but on time arrival. Boarding process a little chaotic. Was moved to 2C, because on my seat was the husband of a handicapped woman. They served their afternoon tea with sandwich and scones which was delicious. Seat comfortable, pitch on the small side.
